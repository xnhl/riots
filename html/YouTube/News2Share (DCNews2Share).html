While the presidency has changed hands, many activists' lives are still affected by last summer. One such activist is Jason Charter.. . Charter was arrested in July 2020, and accused of participating in the destruction of a statue of Confederate Statue of Albert Pike in Washington DC, and the attempted destruction of a statue of the statue of Andrew Jackson that sits outside the White House.. . He faced 20 years in prison, and the Trump administration flaunted the arrest. Then-President Trump even referenced Charter as the "ringleader" at his Mount Rushmore speech on July 4.. . While on pre-trial release, Charter was re-arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault over a confrontation with right-wing journalist Jack Posobiec at a community meeting over whether to remove a statue of Abraham Lincoln from a DC park.. . In October, he was also arrested on the National Mall while protesting a conservative rally advocating voters "Walk Away" from the Democratic Party.. . One year and a new administration later, Charter agreed to plead guilty to a single count of misdemeanor trespassing in order to resolve all of the charges from last year.. . News2Share sat down with Jason Charter to discuss the summer of 2020, the charges, and the future of the antifascist movement.. . Jason Charter is expected to be sentenced on the single misdemeanor count in December. He faces up to six months in jail.. . Interview Produced by Ford Fischer. Featuring Jason Charter. .

For that reason, I will quote the following disclaimer that YouTube used to include on election-related videos: 'Joe Biden is the president of the United States. States certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors, and "Robust safeguards help ensure the integrity of election results.'". . On Friday August 20th, Infowars personality J Owen Shroyer was charged with two counts for his role on January 6: entering restricted grounds, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.. . For the months preceding the Capitol breach on January 6, Shroyer was a prominent figure in the "Stop the Steal" movement. The following is documentary footage of Shroyer's involvement, which mostly consisted of fiery speeches, from the first Million MAGA March in November to the breach on January 6.. .

As with all of the pair's previous events, News2Share believes it is important to document and challenge their generally false and generally disprovable claims.. . News2Share's Ford Fischer and Salon's Zachary Petrizzo were the only two reporters to attend and ask questions of the pair.. . While Congressman Gaetz does face serious allegations of sexual misconduct unrelated to the Burkman/Wohl scene, the claims made by Burkman, Wohl, and a woman they presented as "Gabrielle Lucille Faulkner" (the pair has fabricated the identities of past supposed witnesses in other press conferences) do not appear legitimate.. .

In one instance caught on camera, an officer pointed a weapon around a corner, while another unholstered his handgun as he searched the area.. . They found a bag, but not a person.. . "We just want justice, that's all!" yelled an activist at the police line.. . "Leave now, or you will be arrested!" Officers pushed forward, grabbed a man, and pulled him away from sight behind the shield line.. . A second man walked into the intersection and held his fist in the air, knowing he'd be arrested.. . "Do not resist Darius, give them your hands!" a concerned woman begged from behind him. Police pulled him away and continued their push.. . "Leave now or you will be arrested!" they repeated.. . Some mocked the police by doing wheelies and stunts on four-wheelers and dirt bikes on the street, within view of the police but absolutely out of range of arrest.. . As some of the four-wheel riders sped away past the police, an officer pulled their car out into the intersection in an apparent attempt to block them.. . An occupied vehicle (at least a driver and passenger - maybe more) had been on the block the police had lined up at.. . Officers surrounded the car and arrested the occupants.. . "We are now gonna start arresting press, y'all need to leave," police told journalists toward the end of the night, despite the mayor and governor exempting media from curfew enforcement.. .

"What's his name? Anthony Hulon!" activists chanted. "No justice, no peace! F*** 12! Murdering a** b****es!". . The march began at Lansing's Ferris park where about 60 community activists gathered. The group marched past the Michigan State Capitol to the Lansing Police Department (LPD) Headquarters, where they held a rally. The same building also contains the Lansing jail.. . Hulon, 54, died on April 11, 2020 in the Lansing jail after four Lansing Police Department officers pinned him on his stomach for several minutes while he was handcuffed.. . The situation was recorded by a security camera inside the jail cell.. . Footage shows officers, Edgar Guerra, Gary Worden, Charles Wright and Trevor Allman holding down Hulon even after he said "I can't breathe.". . "Positional asphyxia" was the formal cause of death according to the Ingham County Medical Examiner's Office. The office labeled the death as a homicide.. . Hulon had been arrested twelve hours earlier on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.. . The Buckfire Law firm has filed a lawsuit against the city, the Lansing Police Department, and six individual LPD members for wrongful death, including all four who physically held him down. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the officers involved.. . Lansing resident James Henson - who is forming a Black Panther Party chapter - spoke in front of the LPD HQ.. . "This has been going on for so long, but not only for so long, it's been going on nonstop," said Henson, who carried a handgun on his right leg. "We want change. In order to make that change, we gotta force that change.". . "We need to do things that other people are afraid to do if we want to actually be free," he added.. . Democratic Lansing mayoral candidate Farhan Sheikh-Omar pointed out that "Anthony Hulon died a month before George Floyd.". . Sheikh-Omar criticized Democratic Lansing Mayor Andy Schor for having marched with Black Lives Matter over the summer, after Hulon's death but before the public was aware of the details.. . "Andy Schor marched with this community. He took a knee with this community, knowing that a man had died inside that city jail," he said. "He did not tell us. He did not tell the city council.". . "He did not even give any answers to Anthony Hulon's family," he added. "They had to get a lawyer in order to get answers.". . Sheikh-Omar added that he would fire the officers involved if elected.. . It was originally expected that members of the anti-government "Boogaloo" movement would participate, but apparent political disagreements ahead of the event caused a split. About a dozen armed "Boogaloo" activists arrived as the rally took place, but stood across the street.. . "Politics, that's the way to put it," one masked boogaloo member said when asked about the schism.. . "We're just here to support. That's the answer. That's the only answer you're going to get," another added.. . The groups remained separated as the rally approached its conclusion. The boogaloos chanted along as rally attendees held final chants.. . "No justice, no peace!". . "F*** these racist a** police!". . "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! If we don't get it? Shut it down!". . "If they say later, f*** no, now!". . Heather Hulon, sister of Anthony Hulon, expressed her intent to continue pressing forward with activism.. . "This right here is a start," she said. "I'm gonna keep fighting, fighting for my brother, fighting for everyone else.". . "Together we rise, together we change.". . "It's all of us," Heather Hulon told News2Share in an interview after the rally. "It affects everyone.". . "I can't even put into words how much I appreciate everybody coming out for us," she said.. . Given that charges are not being pressed against the officers involved, she added that justice would mean the officers involved at least being fired.. . "We don't want this to happen to somebody else," she said.. . As to broader police reform, she points to qualified immunity, a doctrine that shield police officers from individual civil liability when they may not reasonably know that their actions were illegal.. . "Retraining I don't think is really the answer. I mean yes, they need to be trained better, but they've been trained, that's their job," she added. "I think it really lies in changing the laws with qualified immunity, but to do that, it takes everybody to get out and vote.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The group brought a large fake pipeline prop designed to look like a snake.. . After a bank employee called police, the group went outside. In total, they spent about five minutes inside. There were no arrests.. . “Tar sands kill, and pipelines will spill, so we’re gonna leave Chase Bank a little message.”. . After leaving the bank lobby, the activists set up police-line style tape labelled “climate emergency” and poured black liquid on the sidewalk to simulate an oil spill.. . “We are here today to demand that Chase Bank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank and other financial institutions immediately stop funding the Line 3 Pipeline. So we took the message directly to them,” organizer Jesse Bogdan with Extinction Rebellion DC told News2Share. “The symbolism of the snake pipeline is in solidarity with indigenous water protectors and indigenous activists who are fighting against this Line 3 Pipeline right now in Minnesota. This black snake symbolizes the poison that it’s bringing to their land.”. . “We spilled oil in front of Chase Bank to show that by investing in the pipeline they are irrevocably harming our planet and leaving damage that will never go away.”. . Bogdan clarified to News2Share that the “oil” was a solution of corn starch, water, and food dye.. . “We are in a climate emergency. Mass extinction is happening now. People are suffering and dying. The climate crisis risks triggering social collapse. And these criminal banks are funding all of this. They are funding climate chaos and social collapse,” a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion added in a press release following the event.. . “If completed, Line 3 will pollute and destroy pristine wetlands, Anishinaabe territories, the Mississippi riverhead, and the coast of Lake Superior, and will intensify the climate breakdown that threatens societal collapse around the world,” the statement said. “Enbridge forges ahead with the pipeline expansion even though it violates indigenous people’s treaty rights.”. . Chase Bank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank, provide billions of dollars to Enbridge to build Line 3, which is expected to transport oil from Canada into the United States.. .

Stop China-Bashing!" rally in Washington DC Chinatown</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Mar 27, 2021</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Activists led by the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) and ANSWER Coalition held a “Stop Anti-Asian Violence! Stop China-Bashing!” rally this afternoon in DC’s Chinatown, one of 60 such rallies nationwide.. . The rally comes in the wake of a shooting targeting women at Asian massage parlors earlier this month in Georgia, killing eight.. . The activists primarily connected anti-Asian racism within the United States to America’s foreign policy in East Asia.. . “The American military is a global parasite,” one activist from George Washington University Students Against Imperialism remarked. “It is a global occupier, and it is objectively a terrorist organization.”. . Local activist Leo Win called out Asian-Americans who “China-bash” by blaming China for Coronavirus in the United States. He says those communities are “shooting themselves in the foot and asking why they’re bleeding.”.  . The event was hosted by PSL’s Sean Blackmon, who told the crowd that Trump drove anti-Asian hate and the Republican Party is “openly racist,” but also added community shouldn’t expect that Democratic Party will help on the issue.. . “We don’t have any help coming from the Democratic Party,” he said. “But Joe Biden is keeping the same policies toward Asian countries, toward China, toward North Korea, toward the entire region, that Donald Trump did.”. . ANSWER Coalition Director Brian Becker gave a speech concluding the rally by predicting that the mainstream media would fail to cover it or the 60 similar events taking place nationwide.. . “There’s a reason that the corporate owned, capitalist owned media won’t report stories like this,” Becker said. “The main reason is that stories like this become contagious, because when some people see other people standing up and fighting and uniting, they want to do the same thing.”. .

I hired freelancer Maranie Rae to film for me on scene, and ultimately published two videos to YouTube.. . The first showed the initial rally and march itself, and the second showed how police fought with participants afterwards. It was fascinating because the video demonstrated the downward spiral in the relationship between the American right and police. This was only five days before the Capitol insurrection.. . In spite of having a clear documentary style and a disclaimer in the video description, YouTube took the video down, marking it as spam presumably because people in it believed the election was stolen. YouTube says disclaimers in the description are insufficient, instead forcing users to editorialize outloud with a "countervailing view.". . The same footage was used on NowThis, but no such penalty is taken for outlets like theirs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrJbYPCf7o8. . For that reason, I am uploading the video in its entirety including the aftermath, but beginning with the following warning.. . As YouTube used to include under election-related videos, Joe Biden is the President of the United States: States certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors.. . As YouTube now includes under some videos: Robust safeguards ensure the integrity of election results. They link to https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol​ to learn more, and I will include that link in the description.. . I hope that this warning suffices for YouTube to allow the video to remain online.

YouTube only allows videos that document people making those claims if the uploader editorializes to repudiate those claims.. . At the time the video was deleted, I even included a disclaimer in the description, which was apparently not enough. I was later informed by the platform that "countervailing views" must be in the video itself.. . The original video was actually used in the impeachment of former President Trump, and I believe history should be able to see the full context.. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bITD0zJ2WpU. . For that reason, I am reuloading the video with the following warning.. . As YouTube used to include under election-related videos, Joe Biden is the President of the United States: States certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors.. . As YouTube now includes under some videos: Robust safeguards ensure the integrity of election results. They link to https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol​ to learn more, and I will include that link in the description.. . I hope that this warning suffices for YouTube to allow the video to remain online. Thank you for watching.". . Original description: . . "NOTE TO YOUTUBE: THIS RECORDING SHOWS RAW FOOTAGE OF A SITUATION IMPORTANT TO NEWS AND DOCUMENTARY UNDERSTANDING AND CRITICISM ONLY.

I'm out of YouTube jail!. . Last week, I was given a formal strike on my YouTube account for footage shot outside the Inauguration of President Biden. YouTube classified the video as "election disinformation.". . In the wake of January 6, very few activists gathered in Washington for the Inauguration. One group that showed up was the "Official Street Preachers.". . The group expressed views most would see as hateful particularly about sexual orientation, and even called a female YouTuber present there a sexist expletive.. . What I found interesting was that two men stood up for her by taking their shirts off. One was a well-known DC-based Antifa activist. The other was ostensibly a Trump supporter, and that's where I got in trouble.. . In order to avoid any further punitive action by the platform, I'd like to remind viewers that President Biden is the president of the United States, and for information about election integrity, you can visit CISA.gov/RumorControl.. . "I still believe that the election was stolen, but you sir, all of you, have been promoting the wrong form of Christianity," one person in the crowd yelled.. . This brief mention was the only reference to the election anyone made in the video. YouTube denied an appeal as well as public pressure campaign, and while my suspension is now over, the video now lives as a permanent warning on my account.. . In my view, the incident reveals a flaw on this platform of "punish first, ask questions later.". . My work is raw, and generally devoid of commentary. I don't think my viewers care what I personally think of the things I cover, and I'm happy not to tell them. YouTube's new standard that even documentary footage must include "countervailing views" on content that shows people who believe - for example - that the election was stolen, effectively makes it impossible to do primary source journalism.. . With that being said, you'll now see the original video, in its entirety, that I was suspended for the next week for. I'll be uploading several other videos that I shot in the past week but was unable to post shortly. Thank you for watching.". . Original video description: . . Members of the hard-right "Official Street Preachers" - who publicly ridicule people in the style of the Westboro Baptist Church - protested near the Capitol this afternoon during President Biden's Inauguration.. . When members called a scantily clad Black female Youtuber a "wh*re," they were confronted by two men who took their shirts off in protest. One was Paul 'Luke' Kuhn, a prominent antifa activist. The other identified himself as a Trump supporter who believes the election was stolen.. . "That woman you called a 'whre' is a woman," said the Trump supporter. "A human fcking being.". .

Below is a statement to YouTube as well as the original text of the description.. . Statement to YouTube: "Hi, I'm Ford Fischer, Editor-in-Chief of News2Share. If you watch this channel frequently but aren't familiar with me, there's a good reason for that. I believe in using raw footage and livestream when possible to show what happens at the events I cover, while keeping commentary from myself absent. I prefer to let viewers watch and decide for themselves, while I make no claims as to whether the people I'm filming are right or wrong.. . This model has brought a politically diverse audience to my work, which I hope to continue building.. . On January 6, I filming the video you're about to watch. Ahead of the Capitol Insurrection, President Trump spoke for nearly 70 minutes, claiming that his election loss was the result of voter fraud. I filmed from within the massive audience, panning around to show their reactions. My footage showed the audience watching his speech beginning to end, and took no positions at all about Trump's claims.. . President Trump has now been impeached and faces trial Monday for alleged "Incitement of Insurrection." Both the Democratic Memorandum and former President Trump's lawyers' memo reference moments captured in my footage, although they interpret it differently. This is exactly why my video is raw, to let the viewers decide for themselves.. . The night before the House delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate, YouTube took the video down, citing the then-president's claims heard in the video as election misinformation. I have had a weeks-long struggle with the platform to get the video back up, which escalated to them demonetizing my entire account, and remonetizing it after a sympathetic article by Fox News.. . In a new email, they tell me that while they're glad to reinstate my monetization, my footage of the then-president speaking can only be up if it "contains countervailing views, and/or additional news/reporting context must be present in the images or audio of the video itself." . . For that reason, I will cite the language YouTube has been putting on videos for the past couple months.. . As YouTube used to include under election-related videos, Joe Biden is the President of the United States: States certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors.. . As YouTube now includes under some videos: Robust safeguards ensure the integrity of election results. They link to https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol to learn more, and I will include that link in the description.. . I hope that this warning suffices for YouTube to allow the video to remain online. Thank you for watching.". . Original video description text:. . "Uncut video shows how the crowd on the National Mall reacted to President Trump's January 6 speech ahead of the Capitol Hill insurgency.. . When Trump compared American elections to "third world countries" and called it a "disgrace," the crowd chanted "fight for Trump!". . "We fight like hell. We fight like hell because if we don't, we're not going to have a country anymore," President Trump said toward the end of his speech.. . "In spite of all that's happened, the best is yet to come," he said before calling for the march on the Capitol.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

A coalition of pro-Trump activists, conservatives, and militia members gathered Sunday afternoon for a "Stop the Steal" vigil and prayer to advocate President Trump retain the presidency for a second term.. . The group - led by pro-Trump operative Ali Alexander - lit candles and prayed, often comparing President Trump to the biblical King David.. . About half a dozen militia activists, most carrying long guns, acted as security for the event. Occasional drivers passing the event yelled at the crowd, but no significant counter-protest occurred. Georgia State Troopers stood by but held a hands-off approach other than directing traffic and encouraging the crowd to remain out of the roadway.. . "Just like I've rejected Saul as king, I've rejected Biden as king, for I'm about to reappoint and re-anoint my David, President Donald J. Trump, to a second term," said one of the first speakers.. . "The Democrats have systematically tried to steal this election," said "Stop the Steal" co-founder Michael Coudrey. "They want to infringe on our constitutional right to free speech.". .

"2020 we will not let them go. We will stop the steal," she said, beginning chants of "Stop the steal!". . "Stop the Steal" co-founder Ali Alexander added that he thinks "the run-off election is important. I do think that these two corporate hacks [Perdue and Loeffler] are the only firewall between us and socialism.". . "The Republicans gotta be on notice. This is the last compromise we make, right?". . Pro-Trump activist Scott Presler invoked scripture "And the Lord said, 'who shall I send?' And I said, 'Here I am Lord, send me.". . He performed a call-and-response. "Will you continue to call your state senators?" he asked.. . "I will!" responded the crowd.. . "Will you vote?" Presler asked.. . "I will!". . "Walk Away" movement founder Brandon Straka took an unsympathetic tone to conservatives suggesting sitting out the run-off election in GA. "This is not the time for us to stand on ceremony and decide that we're going to do a protest that we're not going to vote," he chimed in.. . Conservative author Shemeka Michelle said "people are mocking" President Trump now, which she compared to those mocking Jesus during the crucification. "People laughed at Jesus, now they're laughing at Trump, and now they're laughing at anyone trying to support him," she said.. . "The Lord told me in 2016 'Two terms for this president,'" said the final speaker.. . "It is not over. It is over when a Lion of Judah arrises from his throne, and all his enemies scatter in Jesus' name.". . She began a prayer for Trump and against "the giant of socialism.". .

Nonetheless, we captured the scene and interviews with Trump supporters, who expressed a desire not only to keep the GOP senate, but to prevent Trump from leaving office in January.. . "We didn't lose," President Trump told attendees during his speech. The speech was branded as a rally for senators Perdue and Loeffler, who both appeared, but was largely spent discussing what the president sees as anomalies in his election results. Attendees also focused on the president.. . One Trump supporter told the crowd they need to protest in front of their state capitols in support of "Trump 2020!". . "If they steal it, support President Trump 2024! Why? We've got to stop abortion," he said. "We've got to stop the American Holocaust.". .

The group hoped to showcase and clarify their ideology as several men from another Michigan group stand accused of a plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer.. . "Heed this warning politicians, magistrates, and officers of the law" one said. "You may get away with your tyranny for a time longer, but the day of reckoning rapidly approaches.". . One speaker early on asked the group to take a knee "for all the people who are languishing in American jails for victimless crimes, for all the people who have been killed in our streets by state agents [cops], by people suffering every day because of the power of governments worldwide.". . The activists had invited members of other groups such as Antifa, BLM, NFAC, Proud Boys and others to show up and dialogue, but ultimately the crowd mostly consisted of militia-adjacent activists.. . Two Black Lives Matter activists who were invited to the rally to participate did show up, but felt like the rally's views "weren't in alignment with ours," but they were hoping to change minds.. . "I just don't like the violence behind it or the militia part of it," one said.. . "His name was George Floyd," said one armed speaker at the rally.. . "Her name was Breonna Taylor. His name was Duncan Lemp. His name was Daniel Shaver. And his name was Eric Garner," he said. "Disproportionate use of force by state entities ended the lives of these and many other people.". . Pro-gun activist Maj Toure of "Black Guns Matter" spoke out as well. He pushed back against the idea that the rally participants are "racist" or "white supremacist.". . "We want freedom, we want peace, we want freedom of opportunity," Toure said. . . Filmed by Lee Wingo for N2S. .

In one particularly tense moment, a protester pulled a pro-ACB sign out of the hands of Ashley C. MacLeay (Washington D.C.'s only GOP elected official), ripped it up, and threw the pieces on her.. . Police confronted but did not arrest the protester.. . "ACB! She's with me," chanted MacLeay to protesters who were chanting "RBG! RBG!"  . . "F*** you b****! F*** you b****!" activists on the Women's March side chanted back at her.. . "I just want to say to our counter-protesters over here, they're protesting 'pro-life' but a lot of them don't wanna wear their masks in this crowd," said a Women's March side speaker. "You can't call yourself 'pro-life' and not wear a mask in this crowd!". . One of the pro-life women continued not to wear a mask. Protesters cited . D.C. MayorBowser's masking executive order that technically sets a $1000 fine or 90 days in jail for not wearing a mask in public.. . "90 days in jail! 90 days in jail!" protesters chanted at the woman.

Police Chief Steve R. Drew greeted the activists and offered chocolate milk to Mike Dunn, who had been arrested and disarmed a week earlier under the same ordinance.. . Police stood by and did not make any arrests.. . Dunn - who is still charged with trespassing for open carrying at a Libertarian rally last Thursday - was returned his handgun earlier today, Chief Drew confirmed.. . In a speech to the activists, Chief Drew sent his condolences to the family of Duncan Lemp - a militiaman killed in a no-knock police raid - and said he wants to treat the rally "with the upmost respect" and asked the same from activists.. . Aubrey "Japharii" Jones Jr. of Black Lives Matter 757 spoke out, noting the difference in how police treat unarmed Black Lives Matter activists versus an armed rally like Thursday night's. He called the "this showing of force is absolutely beautiful.". . During his speech, Mike Dunn explained how he defied the local gun ordinance and got arrested last week, and added that "legally, we're not supposed to be open carrying here, but we're all open carrying.". . "We're here openly and blatantly defying unconstitutional city ordinances.". . "Pops" - a Black Lives Matter activist known to carry guns (today he wore six firearms) - described how police "tear gassed" his group when they were unarmed.. .

See Trump's departure in 4K resolution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe3YPj5rmI. . The supporters cheered, waved, honked horns, and chanted “Four More Years!” as Marine One ascended into the air. The president's helicopter flew low and did a half-loop around the crowd before heading to the White House.. . Many of those lined up outside the hospital said they traveled long distances to be there in person. One man from Georgia - who said he had been released from a New York hospital on Sunday - sported a sign that read: “Send French Fries! Get Orange Man Good…Again.”. . Only a small handful of anti-Trump protesters appeared. Police separated an individual in a grim reaper costume from the well-wishers.. . The costumed person was holding up a picture of the President and asking those assembled if they could help find Trump, claiming, “he’s been a big help.”. . After circling over the hospital at low altitude, the helicopter carrying Trump landed at the White House. The president emerged shortly thereafter, took off his mask, and faced the assembled photographers. He then saluted and went inside without answering questions.. . Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted, "I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life. ...

Some of the activists tried to enter Senator Graham's front yard and knock on the door. Police formed a line preventing most from doing so, and forced one protester who got through off the yard. They did not make arrests.. . "He said, 'Use my words against me!'" chanted the activists, referencing Graham's allusion to a situation like this when he was defending not confirming Merrick Garland in 2016.. . "I want you to use my words against me," Graham said during a senate hearing in 2016. "If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.". . Activists held a banner reading "We Can't Sleep So Neither Should Lindsey" while loudly playing back a recording of his own words from 2016.. . “In the spirit of RBG, we will not allow a double standard in how our Congress deals with late-term Supreme Court appointments,” said Aura Angelica, an organizer with Sunrise DC. “Senator Graham told us he wouldn’t allow a Supreme Court nominee during an election year-- he told us to use his words against him if a seat opened up this late in the game-- we’re here today, doing just that.”. . "We're using your words against you," wrote an activist in sidewalk chalk in front of the senator's home.. . Inspector Robert Glover of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Special Operation Division told an organizer that the protest outside Senator Graham's house was in violation of DC's "Residential Tranquility Act" and that they'd begin arresting if they didn't leave.. . He specifically added he'd arrest media at the event as well.. . MPD Lieutenant Jason Bagshaw used an amplifier in Inspector Glover's call to issue a first warning to the protesters threatening arrest.. . "We will not compromise with a simple-minded racist" an activist replied.. . After Lieutenant Bagshaw issued a second arrest warning and ordered protesters to leave southbound, they briefly marched north toward the police, but then turned around leaving the way police told them to.. . "You can't stop the revolution!" they chanted. "No justice, no peace!". . "We need a new court," an organizer said as the group marched to the Supreme Court. "We need a court that actually has term limits.". . "Expand the court! Expand the court!" the group chanted.. . Before wrapping, organizers read out the home address of Kansas Senator Pat Roberts in Alexandria, Virginia, and suggested that he or Colorado Senator Cory Gardner should be the next target of a wakeup event.. . They added that this could be done in their home states as well.. . Sunrise described themselves as "a youth movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process.". . Shut Down DC describes themselves as "an alliance of people and organizations committed to an array of social justice issues, coming together to highlight the overlapping causes of the climate crisis in the United States.". .

The group espouses Black nationalist ideology, but specifically rallies in Louisville to demand that the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor be arrested.. . Breonna Taylor was a 26-year-old black woman shot and killed by police officers in a no-knock raid on her home by the Louisville Police Department in March. The shooting sparked nationwide protests. One officer has been fired, but none have been charged.. . The NFAC injured three members last month in an accidental discharge when they also gathered in Louisville.. . "Under no circumstances will you chamber a round," said John Fitzgerald Johnson, who leads the NFAC under the pseudonym "Grandmaster Jay.". . "Our rules of engagement are very simple," he told his group before the march. "Under no circumstances will you point your weapon at anyone, unless they point at you first. If they do, don't shoot them. Kill them.". . As the group - each member bearing at least one rifle or shotgun - marched toward Churchill Downs, chants of "say her name, Breonna Taylor!" broke out in the formation.. . Johnson instructed the group to pause and kneel.. . "NFAC does not chant," he said. "We don't do none of that shit, so if you're NFAC, I don't want to hear that bullshit.". . When the NFAC arrived at Churchill Downs itself, a fence had already been erected to keep activists on the opposite side of the street. As the Kentucky Derby began, riot police stood across the street closer to the horse race itself.. . Johnson approached the gate to speak directly to police.. . "If you could kill me right now, you know your ass would," Grandmaster Jay told officers. "Take your shot.". . "You said I'm your worst nightmare," he told them. "Black male, could energize the Black nationalist movement. Listen to this.". . He then led the group in a "Black power" chant.. . Until Freedom, another group demanding that Breonna Taylor's killers be arrested, also arrived at Churchill Downs to protest.. . Struggling to keep the two groups separate, the NFAC instead marched away early.. . Following the event, Grandmaster Jay told reporters why only he speaks to the media and the rest of his members remain anonymous.. . "The United States has a history of hunting down and killing black organizations," he said. "So therefore, as much as some people want to be in the spotlight, everyone who has stepped where I am standing has been shot and killed. Everyone.". . "So this time I'm protecting the members by not letting you see who they are," he added.. . "If you kill me, there is someone already in my place.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

A coalition of armed pro-Trump and militia activists marched to City Hall in the morning, where they were confronted by armed antifascist and antiracist counter-protesters.. . The group was led by Dylan Stevens, who styles himself and his followers as the "Angry Viking" militia.. . "Back the blue," his group chanted as they entered, in reference to the police.. . "Fuck the blue," replied counter-protesters.. . The situation briefly escalated into shouting and violence. During a few pushing matches, activists opposing the "Angry Viking" militia and their supporters unholstered handguns.. . No shots were fired.. . Following about an hour of confrontation, "Angry Viking" militia leader Dylan Stevens declared "we're leaving.". . citing the fact that activists counter-protesting them had been out in that area for over three months.. . "Apparently, this group has been out for 101 days," said Stevens. "Honestly, I had no clue about it.". . "No justice! No Derby! No justice! No Derby!" chanted the counter-protesters.. .

Al Sharpton, MLK III, Lead ‘Get Your Knees off Our Necks’ March</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 28, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Thousands of racial justice activists, allies, and supporters coalesced on the National Mall in Washington D.C. for the National Action Network’s “Get Your Knees off Our Necks” Commitment March on Friday. Led by the Reverend Al Sharpton, the event lands on the 57th anniversary of Martin Luther King’s Historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. . . The speakers at the Lincoln Memorial ranged from grassroots activists, to academics, to theologians, to business & labor leaders and sitting members of congress.. . The tones of the speeches varied from apolitical to full-throated endorsements of politicians running against President Trump. Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris appeared in a video message at the event, urging activists to continue their efforts in the spirit of those who came before them, such as the late Rep. John Lewis. . . MLK Jr’s son, Martin Luther King III, and MLK Jr’s granddaughter Yolanda King were two of the event’s featured speakers.. . MLK III spoke broadly about a host of issues in America, and urged listeners to continue the efforts championed by MLK Jr. and civil rights leaders of the 1950s and 60s.. . “There's a knee upon the neck of democracy, and our nation can only live so long without the oxygen of freedom,” he said, adding that if activists continue to move with purpose and passion, they would be able to complete the work started by his father. . . The youngest King professed the hope that her generation would be the one to end systemic racism. The 12-year-old stressed the goal of the movement was “genuine equality.”. . Reverend Al Sharpton headlined the speaking portion of the event, leading attendees in chants of “No Justice, No Peace!”. . He, like many prior speakers, drew parallels between the circumstances of 1963 and 2020, speaking out about the perception that the Trump administration may be attempting to “rob” voting rights from African-Americans, a sentiment shared by many activists.. . Sharpton spoke in support of the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed in the House of Representatives, but has not yet been passed in the senate. He also advocated for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.. . “Demonstration without legislation will not lead to change,” said Sharpton. “We didn’t come to start trouble, we came to stop trouble.” . . The event is one of the largest sanctioned gatherings during the Coronavirus pandemic, and while many in attendance wore masks and attempted to keep distance, large crowds closely packed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and the Reflecting Pool.. . Sharpton advised attendees to socially distance if possible, but noted the importance of the gathering. “Even though we are here in the midst of a pandemic...we want to show with our bodies that enough is enough.” . . Also speaking were Tamika Palmer, mother of Breonna Taylor, Letetra Widman and Jacob Blake Sr, sister and father of Jacob Blake, and Bridgett & Philonise Floyd, sister and brother of George Floyd, and many other family members of those killed by law enforcement or suspected white supremacists.. . So many family members assembled to speak, that not every person could be accommodated, as event organizers had to direct attendees for marching.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. Article by Joel Simon. .

They say they weren't protesting, but rather on standby to "back up" law enforcement. The group claimed to be aware of "credible threats" that Louisville could encounter, but did not clarify further.. . Community members including several livestreamers - some of them armed themselves - argued with the militia group about their purpose in being there. LMPD monitored the situation, which did not become violent.. . The "National Patriotic Defense Team" had originally tried to block off the parking lot to people outside the organization, but after complaints, the police asked them to open the area up again.. . The "Not F***ing Around Coalition" (NFAC) had declared in Louisville on July 25 that four weeks later, they would "burn the motherf***er down" if the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor had not been arrested by then. As of Saturday - precisely four weeks after July 25 - the officers had not been arrested,  but the NFAC didn't return.. . However, the NFAC has announced plans to come to Louisville on September 5, the day of the Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby will occur without a live audience.. . The "National Patriotic Defense Team" has said they would also be present at the Kentucky Derby.. . News2Share tentatively plans to cover whatever happens in Louisville on September 5.. .

Last week, the Chamber of Commerce removed the art and replaced it with a photo mural, so this weekend, activists with "The Palm Collective" held a "Reclaim D.C." event to create new art and fill the wall with it once again.. . The Chamber of Commerce said that the artwork was being preserved for display in local institutions, including museums.. . Organizers say they were never consulted.. . “Reclaim DC came out of the widespread shock and horror of a healing space, the H Street art tunnel, being taken down without the community’s consent or support,” said Beth Yirga, an organizer with the Palm Collective, a collective of DC advocacy organizations which promoted the event.. . Yirga compared the event to the Harlem Renaissance, saying “very dark times bring beautiful pieces of healing and love and connection.”. . The event atmosphere was relaxed, with a DJ playing music while adults and children spray painted, wrote on, and applied glitter to posters, panels, and the street and sidewalk.. . DC Police initially kept their distance before forming a line to keep protesters out of the street.. . Filmed by N2S Contributor TJ Jones. .

The event was countered by the F.L.O.W.E.R. Coalition (FrontLine Organization Working to End Racism), a group of protesters - some armed - who view the monument as a lasting relic to white supremacy.. . Violence broke out between the two sides, with brawls leaving several injuries. No shots were fired, and no arrests were made.. . Police stayed out of the conflict for the first five hours. In the early afternoon, police declared the event unlawful and forced both sides to disperse.. . The carving, which had been worked on until 1928, depicts Confederate leaders Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson. It was originally funded in part with aid from the Ku Klux Klan. In 1960, the State of Georgia bought the property, rendering it a state park.. . The City of Stone Mountain announced Friday evening that the entire park would be closed due to the demonstrations.. . Chris Hill led the Georgia Chapter of the III% Security Force into the event.. . The activists supporting the monument organized under the monicker of "Heritage Not Hate.". . Atlanta Antifa, which is itself a part of the F.L.O.W.E.R. coalition, disagrees, calling Stone Mountain a "racist landmark." Ahead of the event, they released an article noting the promotion of the event by formerly avowed neo-Nazi Adam Wesley Sitton, 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally participant Chester Doles, and avowed white nationalist Michael "Weaver" Carothers. None of the three ultimately participated Saturday.. . “III%” refers to the historical theory that only three percent of the population of the American colonies participated in the revolution against Britain. It is now used by right-of-center non-government militia groups in the United States.. . The all-Black "Not F***ing Around Coalition" (NFAC) militia had been rumored to attend the event, but confirmed Wednesday evening that they would not be coming. The NFAC held an armed march in early July at Stone Mountain also advocating the removal of the confederate monument.. . In February 2019, the F.L.O.W.E.R. Coalition held a march unopposed after right-wingers cancelled their plans to hold a rally in support of the monument. The group burned an effigy of a Klansman and chanted "Sandblast Stone Mountain!". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

A handful of feds watched on his property as the activists demanded ICE "free them all!". . Protesters focused particularly on the use of tear gas by federal agents in Portland. They contend that tear gas may be an aborticide, and pregnant protesters could be at risk of losing their babies.. . "Let's get real about what the values are of this administration," said one activist, criticizing the use of what she calls "abortion gas" by the Trump administration, which frames itself as anti-abortion.. . Paul 'Luke' Kuhn, a frequent in the Washington DC protest space, added that a COVID spike could be occurring in Portland unlike other cities with demonstrations.. . He says that perhaps tear gas is exacerbating the spread of COVID among activists and those around them.. . Before leaving Secretary Chad Wolf's Alexandria home, the activists told the federal agent guarding the home that they should quit their jobs and "do something ethical for your country" like "work for the postal service.". .

Wohl says he had a romantic and sexual relationship with Corrigan at the time.. . Corrigan had served as deputy White House liaison for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID.). . According to reporting by Will Sommer at Daily Best, Corrigan later claimed that the texts had been sent by Wohl on her behalf and without her consent.. . "I did NOT send these messages, and while I vehemently protested about them being sent in my name, my devices were not in my control," she told Daily Beast in a statement. "I see now that I was part of an abusive scheme and I was used to attack people that have nothing to do with me.". . Wohl then released a statement calling for the Thursday press conference and stating that he'd falsely been accused of "kidnapping" Corrigan.. . Burkman and Wohl spent the press conference denying the allegations, and blaming them on conservative journalist Raheem Kassam, a long-time friend of Corrigan who apparently came to her aid.. . Following the press conference, Wohl published a 90 second recording from a two hour conversation he reports having with Corrigan after the incident that he claims exonerates him of wrongdoing.. . The recording, however, shows Corrigan accusing Wohl of preventing her from having contact with her friends, and Wohl accusing Kassam of creating the situation.. . Corrigan doesn't appear to say anything corroborating Wohl's account of events.. . Reached for comment, Kassam told News2Share that, "my involvement in the matter extends to picking up my old friend when she called crying asking for help, and helping her explain to reporters that she didn't send the tweets of her own volition.". .

"My name is Jason Charter, and I am a proud antifascist," he began.. . "The 'ringleader of antifa' statement is as absurd as it is false," he said. "Antifa is an idea which simply means to be against fascism.". . "We organize horizontally and don't believe in a hierarchy, so can how could there be leaders?" he asked. "The only reason I was arrested was so Trump could put a face to the unrest around the country surrounding the longstanding racism in the United States.". . Charter currently faces three felony counts related to the statue of Andrew Jackson in front of the White House, which was vandalized on June 22, 2020 by a group of George Floyd protesters.. . The charges include Destruction of Government Property, Destruction of Veterans' Memorials, and Aiding and Abetting.. .

One occupant said that the “CHAZ” has been misrepresented by news organizations like Fox, who try to brand them as violent and even “terrorist.” He says CHAZ is a chance to protest against racism and express a need to reallocate funding from police and toward social programs.. . Cal Anderson Park, which falls entirely inside the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” has become a place where participants are given a stage to speak on the issues they advocate for: namely abolishing racism, capitalism, and policing.. .

The group began outside St. John's Church, where two weeks ago protesters had been forced away by police and military forces ahead of President Trump posing there with a bible.. . The march was led by Sean Blackmon with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and musician Kenny Sway.. . "It was not curfew yet," said Blackmon in front of St. John's. "The police and all the agencies came down this street. And they were firing flash bang grenades.". . "They were shooting tear gas, pepper spray, all sorts of things to disrupt the demonstration," he said. "And they broke us up.". . Activists blocked the highway during rush-hour traffic to commemorate the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police. The officers involved in Floyd's death have been arrested and charged; officers who shot Taylor have not been charged.. . Some drivers participated in the protest as their cars were blocked, but a few took issue. One woman exited her car to argue with protesters, while another tried to drive by and was blocked by a police cruiser.. . After several minutes, the group marched back to the White House and dispersed peacefully.. . "This is what I want to do next. I really want to cause a lot of ruckus in these neighborhoods," said Sway of future protests. "Even if we gotta go to each neighborhood for 30 minutes to wake their ass up. We gotta do it.". . There were no injuries or arrests.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. . NO REUSE WITHOUT PERMISSION Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

"But abortion care cannot be just a privilege preserved for those in the right state, the right economic class," she added. "It must be a right.". . "Abortion in legal in this country, and it needs to be available to everybody" said Rep. Diana DeGette who led a chant of "Our voice is our power.". . "Here is a memo to Donald Trump and his appointees to this court. This is what America looks like, and America is for reproductive rights," said Senator Blumenthal. "America is for the principle: My right, my decision!". . "I became an abortion provider, because abortion is an essential part of healthcare," said Katie McHugh, an OB/GYN and abortion provider "And because patients need and deserve care that is based on medicine, science and fact.". . "The fact is that laws posing an undue burden without improving patient care are unconstitutional," she said.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Friday night, police attempted to prevent activists from entering the subway, sometimes pushing them away to erect barriers.. . "Back the fuck up!" yelled an officer at an activist trying to get into the subway.. . Dozens made it in through an uncovered entrance, either hopping the turnstiles or going through an emergency gate.. . The activists spanned as far as Brooklyn, where police deployed mace on at least one occasion.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

A planned ‘Militia March on Richmond’ event coincided with Lobby Day, the Virginia Citizen’s Defense League’s (VCDL) annual petition to state government to maintain their second amendment rights without restriction.. . Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency ahead of the event, citing his fear of a repeat of the deadly 2017 rally in Charlottesville. Despite anxiety over the event turning violent, no violence or arrests reportedly occurred during the event.. . “This is the safest place in the world right now,” Shane, a gun owner in attendance, said.. . Chain-link fencing and security checkpoints separated Lobby Day rally goers depending on if they entered capitol grounds or not. Those entering the capitol grounds were made to comply with a ban on various items and weapons including guns, torches and nun-chucks to enter the enclosed grounds.. . Starting before sunrise, hundreds stood in line to enter the grounds, unarmed, to voice their concerns over proposed legislation.. . Sheriff S. H. Jenkins said that sheriffs and commonwealth attorneys need to stand up to gun laws.. . "There is a line that we will not allow to be crossed when it comes to the Second Amendment," he said.. . For demonstrators not on capitol grounds, less restrictions applied. Hundreds openly carried long guns, the most common being variants of the AR-15, which proposed legislation would ban.. . Numerous militias, armed and often in full gear, made a presence in the overflowing streets surrounding the Statehouse.. . Lightfoot Militia, a civilian paramilitary organization present at the Charlottesville riots, was in attendance. The group marched through the streets with full color guard representing the militias multiple nationwide chapters, dispersing after presenting arms on north tenth street and singing ‘God Bless the U.S.A.,’ by Lee Greenwood.. . Chants of “USA USA USA,” “Don’t Tread on Me” and “Sic Semper Tyrannis,” could be heard billowing from demonstrators at any given moment.. . Along the many closed roads and street corners pop up shops sold clothing items popular with supporters of President Trump.. . “Don’t be a Democrat, get yourself a Trump hat,” yelled one vendor to passersby.. . “The man under the sheet wants to take your guns” was a common slogan on many signs, capitalizing on Gov. Northam’s blackface scandal. Official VCDL signs depicted a photo of two men, one is believed to be the Governor in either blackface or a Klu Klux Klan outfit. “We want black owned rifles not black faced governors,” chanted demonstrators.. . Hundreds of Richmond City Police and Virginia State Police officers were stationed across the capitol district, often manning barriers between sidewalks and off-limits roads.. . One woman was reportedly arrested after the rally for allegedly wearing and refusing to remove a bandana.. . Many attendees of the event covered their faces in balaclavas, bandanas and scarves. One unnamed police officer reportedly claimed they allowed masks due to the cold weather.. . Alex Jones, a popular conspiracy theorist, made an appearance in his customized MRAP troop transport. Jones was greeted eagerly and warmly by large crowds of people between rides in his armored vehicle.. . “You all keep thanking me, but I want to thank you!” Jones yelled after addressing a huddled group of journalists and supporters, “for being true American citizens!”. .

The reality show's premise would have been that as we cover events side-by-side, camera crews would follow us to document the "behind the scenes" of our unique brands, our conflicts with the mainstream media establishment (for example - social media censorship) as well as our own philosophical disagreements with one another.. . Participants would have been Carey Wedler (then editor-at-large of The Anti-Media, Youtuber), Justin King (editor of The Fifth Column, best known for his video opinion column Beau of the Fifth Column), Derrick Broze (Founder, CEO of The Conscious Resistance Network), Nick Bernabe (editor-at-large of The Anti-Media), Robert Caputo (media entrepreneur), and Ford Fischer (editor-in-chief of News2Share.). .

"Just because you cross the border doesn't mean you're less human," said Congressman Castro. "Everybody deserves medical treatment, certain standards of care, dignity and basic respect and humanity.". . Castro explained that he's proposed legislation that would at least require CBP and ICE to report migrant deaths in their custody to congress.. . An emergency room pediatrician spoke out, explaining that she'd been able to review the autopsies of children dead in CBP's custody. Half, she says, died with the flu.. . Despite a CDC recommendation to give detainees the flu vaccine, she says CBP has not made that policy.. . "Never again means now, Jews say close the camps" said one poster with an image of a migrant child with her arm around Anne Frank.. . The group ended with a prayer facing CBP directly. They prayed that they will continue until "no children are detained but are rather welcomed into our communities, and welcomed as families to our tables. Amen.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

"We entered into the back part of her office which was off limits," said Russell Gray, an Extinction Rebellion DC organizer. "We were there for about 30 seconds and we didn't see her, and we tried to walk out.". . "The police stopped us and arrested everybody that was in there.". . “We are hungry and angry. Pelosi’s refusal to meet with us just confirms that our leaders are ignoring the emergency. Scientists tell us that the collapse of society is inevitable unless we act now. So we will continue our hunger strike in jail if that’s what it takes to prevent this collapse,” said Giovanni Tamacas, 20, from San Francisco, California, before police arrested him.. . Mr Tamacas is the coordinator of the Global Hunger Strike. He quit his job on the hill last week so that he could hunger strike in Pelosi’s office. . . All nine are being charged with unlawful entry.. . Most activists are given three warnings in the capitol before arrests are made. In this case, the order to arrest was immediate upon police entry into the office.. . The group had been on a hunger strike, occupying her office since Monday. They say Pelosi stands in the way of the Democratic Party being unified in supporting the Green New Deal.. . The action is one of several international hunger strike actions taking place by various chapters of Extinction Rebellion with mixed success. Two political parties in the United Kingdom reportedly met with strikers earlier this week.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The call has prompted calls for impeachment from Speaker Pelosi, who believes it shows that President Trump asked for "dirt" on his opponent Joe Biden.. . Biden allegedly pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Russian Prosecutor Viktor Shokin in relation to an investigation of his son, Hunter Biden.. . Wohl claims he visited Ukraine and personally interviewed Shokin, only presenting an alleged transcript and flight ticket as evidence. He and Burkman claim that photographs exist of Wohl with Shokin, but no such images have yet been released.. . Both claim they have the identity of the whistleblower and had intended to announce it at the press conference but that they were delaying release on request by the government. They set a deadline of Wednesday at noon for themselves to release it, adding that it may be released anyway.. . They claim that two Democratic candidates - John Delaney and Bernie Sanders - have passed their "vetting process" and that Delaney went to Burkman's Arlington home to do so.

The D.C. chapter of Extinction Rebellion, which often preaches direct action in order to combat what it sees as an effort to obscure truth about climate change from the public, risked arrest in support of a non-binding resolution that would have the U.S. join cities and countries worldwide in recognizing the urgency of climate change and its impact on human populations.. . On July 9, a non-binding resolution for a climate emergency at the federal level was introduced by Democratic members of Congress including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.. . But following two weeks with no movement on the resolution in either house of Congress, Extinction Rebellion DC opted to activate its plan for escalation and follow in the footsteps of its sister chapters in the United Kingdom: "Disrupt Congress like it’s never been disrupted before.". . Sixteen of Extinction Rebellion's protesters descended into the Cannon and Rayburn house office buildings willing to risk arrest, according to Kaela Bamberger, a core organizer. Using superglue to stick their hands to the walls and form a human chain, they blocked both ends of an underground tunnel leading into the U.S. Capitol.. . After clearing media and other protesters out of view, police requested a solvent be brought in to safely decouple the activists over the course of the next two hours.. . It was unclear if all the 16 who intended to be arrest were in fact detained. Several other organizers counted around a dozen activists being led away by Capitol police. The nature of their charges was unclear.. . Filmed and edited by Alejandro Alvarez. .

An organizer with Faith in Action said 70 people attending its "Catholic Day of Action" risked arrest inside the Russell Senate Office Building over the span of an hour, chanting and praying while defying orders from Capitol police to disperse.. . Protesters held pictures of at least six immigrant children known to have died in U.S. custody since early last year. Several people lay down in the Russell building's rotunda, forming a cross while others sang hymns as police slowly rallied to detain them with plastic handcuffs.. . The Catholic-led event in D.C. comes days after Jewish activists with Never Again Action were arrested during their own civil disobedience actions, within both the U.S. Capitol and the headquarters of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.. . "Images of immigrant children detained in cages, separated from family members, and living in unsanitary, unhealthy conditions have outraged the nation in recent days," Faith in Action said on its Facebook invite.. . "The faith community has decried this treatment of children not only as a violation of human dignity and rights, but also as contrary to religious teachings and the sacred call to care for people who are most at risk, especially children.". . Leaders of multiple faiths have been holding sit-ins and marches near ICE and Customs and Border Protection facilities around the country, as reports continue to emerge of unsanitary and overcrowded conditions in federal detention centers.. . Capitol police had not provided a number of arrests nor details on charges as of Wednesday afternoon. In the past, participants of similar actions have been charged under D.C. law for obstructing or incommoding, and let out with a small fine after processing offsite.. . Filmed by Alejandro Alvarez. .

The panel took place at FreedomFest, a conservative/libertarian conference which bills itself as the "largest liberty conference event of the year.". . The panel, moderated by Gary Alexander (Senior Writer, Navellier.com) explored the way in which communist nations have used media to shift narrative, and how other nations' media - including the US - communicate about world events.. . Adam Kokesh - a veteran - expanded the conversation to include that he considers his military service in Iraq a form of socialism. Since returning home, he has spent the past decade railing against hawkish American foreign policy, including the war in Iraq.. .

The group marched from Spirit of Justice Park to the Capitol. While no arrests occurred, police repeatedly pushed activists from the streets back onto the sidewalk.. . A US Capitol Police officer on a motorcycle at one point interacted with a one activist. As the officer yelled "Sidewalk please! Sidewalk! Sidewalk!" the activist offered "Stay in the street!". . "Don't listen to him!" the officer yelled.. . "It's a climate emergency!" said the activist.. . "No it's not, get on the sidewalk!" replied the officer.. . The group promised to come back soon if the resolution isn't passed, adding that they don't have a "lick of faith" in Nancy Pelosi to get it passed.. . One individual was detained briefly after attempting to use chalk at the Capitol. Capitol police took out handcuffs but didn't put him on them.. . "Let him go! Let him go," the crowd chanted.. .

The protesters focused on the fact that taxpayer dollars were being spent to keep out other tourists and outdoorsmen who would have otherwise used the facilities.. . One demonstrator argued with police after he wouldn't let her go into the hotel area to use the bathroom, so she dropped her pants and peed at the demonstration. She was not arrested, but she was forced to leave by park rangers.. . Officers also threatened to make arrests and charge with misdemeanor "disorderly conduct" if antifa used swear words during their demonstration.. . As they protested, a couple members of "League of the South" came outside to antifa watch across the river, but no direct confrontations occurred.. . Before leaving, antifa rented two paddle boats to get closer to the conference by water. They waived an antifa flag and held a banner reading "White Supremacy Kills.". . The conference is expected to conclude Sunday.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

CODEPINK and the ANSWER Coalition, two prominent left-wing activist collectives describing themselves as anti-war and anti-imperialist, rallied about 50 people near the White House’s north lawn.. . Their proposal for conflict resolution is two-fold: Drop sanctions and reinstate the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — widely known as the Iran nuclear deal.. . “We are very glad that President Trump said he didn’t want to kill 150 people, and called off this latest round of bombing in Iran,” CODEPINK co-founder Medea Benjamin said, after Trump aborted an attack against Iranian anti-air assets moments before it would have been carried out on Thursday. . . Benjamin accused the Trump administration, specifically National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, of orchestrating economic warfare by abruptly withdrawing from the Iran deal.. . “We know that every single day, people are being killed in Iran because of the sanctions,” she said. “You know sanctions are a form of warfare, right?”. . Fulfilling a campaign promise, Trump opted to leave the deal in 2017. He deemed it unfair to the U.S. and insufficient to prevent the Islamic Republic from building a nuclear weapon. A proposal for an improved deal has yet to materialize.. . With sanctions growing progressively more strict, the U.S. and Iran have spent the better part of two years moving further apart diplomatically and closer to open conflict. . . Tensions rose in the Gulf of Oman this month when two tankers were damaged by explosions, which the U.S. Navy alleges were caused by Iranian limpet mines.. . Last week, a Global Hawk surveillance drone was shot down by the Iranian military, who said it violated their airspace — a claim the Pentagon categorically denies, saying the drone had been flying within international airspace.. . With the situation deteriorating, CODEPINK sent out a call on Friday for what it called an emergency action to prevent war. . . Boasting a tight-knit community, anti-war activists in D.C. have proven quick to organize, and three days later several dozen people stood outside the White House to oppose a conflict.. . Among them was Brian Becker, director of the ANSWER Coalition, who likened “warmongering” American political messaging on Iran to the early days of the Vietnam war. . . “Are we going to let these lunatics drag us into another Vietnam War,” Becker asked, implicating MSNBC and Fox News as media outlets serving the “military-industrial complex” through bellicose rhetoric.. .

On Sunday, Bolton traveled to Jerusalem for a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said Iran should not “mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness” following Trump’s decision to rescind a strike.. . Trump headed to Camp David for consultations with senior advisors on Iran this weekend, while the Washington Post reports a U.S.-sanctioned cyberattack recently sought to cripple Iran’s missile control systems.. . During an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” airing Sunday, Trump said he preferred to seek a deal but had not ruled out military action, telling host Chuck Todd: “I’m not looking for war, and if there is, it’ll be obliteration like you’ve never seen before.”. .

Ahead of the event, a dispute took place over the presence of a particular flag: The rainbow LGBT pride flag with the Star of David on it.. . Is it a Jewish queer pride flag, or an Israeli one? That was the heart of the issue. The organizers of the Dyke March had asked that this precise design not be brought to the event because they didn't want any "nationalist symbols.". . The American flag, even stylized with a rainbow, was also banned.. . The activists with the flag, some of whom identified as Zionists, said that they see the flag simply as an expression of Jewish-queer intersectional identity, and not national identity. Interpreting it as Zionist, they say, is a form of Antisemitism.. . View video of the march itself: https://youtu.be/Nk8VBmESsVw. . Filmed by Ford Fischer . .

The pro-Trump activist identified himself later as Greg Aselbekian, who describes himself as an Infantryman at United States Marine Corps on Facebook.. . Aselbekian called Secret Service over multiple times, who stood nearby but didn't intervene.. . "I said Heil Hitler, bitch! Trump follows the playbook of the third reich," the woman said. On a few occasions she threw nazi salutes to imply Trump is a nazi.. . She used the n-word for the same reason.. . When the Trump supporter called her out on that, an African American woman interjected that "racist policy is worse than the N-word.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The group of about a dozen men and women came armed to counter a Ku Klux Klan rally in the city of Dayton. Approximately 650 individuals comprised a "Rainbow Coalition" mostly comprised of leftist groups countering the nine Klansmen who showed up.. . With 350 police officers present, the New Black Panther Party explained to News2Share that they see the police as the threat, and siding with the Klan over the community.. . "They don't treat us equally," one pointed out.. .

In total, only nine Klansmen attended. The group had two banners, one reading "Honorable Sacred Knights of the Ku Klux Klan" and the other reading "Diversity = Genocide." One held a sign reading "It's ok to be white" with the "ok" hand sign.. . They also waved KKK, American, and confederate flags.. . The group was permitted to be masked and carry handguns under the consent decree they reached with the city of Dayton.. . The group assembled at Courthouse Square, and had a barricade, 60 meters of empty space, two police lines, and two fences between them and the coalition of counter-demonstrators.. . Dayton City Manager Shelley Dickstein told the Dayton Daily News that the KKK rally cost the city about $650,000 in personnel and materials.. . Over 650 police officers were present.. . In spite of the police presence, many activists from several groups came armed themselves, open carrying rifles and handguns. Many activists expressed skepticism that the police were there to protect the community, as opposed to the Klansmen themselves. . "Who do you protect? Who do you serve?" the activists chanted. "Cops and the Klan go hand in hand!". . Black power! Black power!" chanted the Dayton chapter of the New Black Panther Party, which came heavily armed.. . They say they see police as favoring the Klan side, so they believe in constitutionally defending themselves.. . Some carried instruments to rally the counter-demonstrators or mock the Klansmen. . . One tuba player played "Ride Of The Valkyries" in a slow and mocking tempo as the KKK members left around 3pm.. . "Fuck the KKK! Fuck the KKK!" some chanted as they departed.. . No violence occurred, and no arrests were officially made, although one individual were reportedly arrested and let go without charge for J-walking.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Join: https://www.minds.com/register?referrer=fordfischer. . This comes as a supplement, not a replacement, to News2Share's presence on Facebook, Twitter (with separate accounts for its editor-in-chief and news director) and Youtube.. . The problem with those most common social networking platforms is that they all face varying degrees of censorship, deplatforming, and demonetization.. . Facebook and Youtube both have programs allowing content creators to be paid for ad revenue generated by their work, but tend to demonetize videos dealing with controversial subjects. Youtube has deemed videos of News2Share's to be 18+ acceptable only. These include videos of anti-fascist protesters on inauguration day, and activists smoking marijuana, for example.. . While Twitter has had fewer cases of censorship regarding News2Share content, their format is inherently limiting based on a 2 minute 20 second video limit, and a 280-character limit for each tweet.. . Entire bodies of content are also vulnerable due to account suspensions. For example, journalist Sandi Bachom twice had her profile suspended after she reported on fascist activists. Her adversaries, she wrote, were "Weaponizing twitter to make us self censor.". . Minds, on the other hand, believes that "Surveillance, algorithm manipulation and censorship are infecting the web at unprecedented levels. For the first time in history, millions of users are abandoning traditional, centralized social apps in favor of freedom-based alternatives.". . They hope to be the solution in this alternative paradigm. While the website is still in its early stages, it already has a mix of political ideologies represented, and it has demonstrated a commitment not to censor, prioritize, or monetize based on political orientation.. . As an outlet that covers a range of events and activism with a variety of political opinions involved and presents them objectively, without commentary, impartial content management is something News2Share values.. . In the spirit of presenting a diversity of opinions in an objective fashion, we believe in diversifying the platforms we publish on. News2Share would like to welcome Minds to that family as an outlet with a lot of promise.. .

The Proud Boys consider themselves a "Western Chauvinist" fraternity, but they are classified by the SPLC as an "SPLC Designated Hate Group.". . "The SPLC is the glue holding together all the media's lies about us," said Enrique Tarrio. The group argued that they are wrongly identified and are suing for slander.. . After a violent incident in New York City in 2018, several Proud Boys-affiliated pages were removed from social media.. . The group broadly sees deplatforming from social media and payment processors as a consequence of the hate group designation.. . This action comes separately from Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes's lawsuit against the SPLC for slander. McInnes has since disavowed the Proud Boys, saying he was done with the group “forever.”. . Asked by The Daily Beast's Will Sommer (the only media other than News2share in attendance) the group said it couldn't announce their attorneys yet but will have specifics out to the media about the lawsuit in the coming days.. . The link below is the SPLC's "Extremist file" on the group, which is often cited by the media and is the crux of the lawsuit.. https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys. .

About a dozen reporters including Jared Holt from Right Wing Watch and Will Sommer from The Daily Beast were present, as well as two private security personnel. One was a uniformed private agent from Acclaim Guards Security, while the other wore plain clothes, a firearm and handcuffs but no visible badge or credential.. . An individual going by the name Hunter Kelly had posted a story on Medium accusing Mayor Buttigieg of sexual assault, but later took it down. He now says that Wohl and Burkman put him up to it, as does a Republican source who allegedly spoke to The Daily Beast and offered a recording as evidence.. . Kelly also claims that he was prevented from leaving by the Wohl and Burkman, which they disputed by presenting footage of him on his computer at Burkman's home, not in any apparent signs of distress.. . Burkman says he intends to sue The Daily Beast for $100 million if they don't release the recording by Friday.. . Burkman and Wohl say that the alleged survivor recanted his story due to third party threats, including from his parents. They say that they witnessed these calls taking place, but have no record of them.. . If that's true, News2Share's Ford Fischer asked, why didn't they record them?. . They say they didn't have the foresight to do so.. . "First of all, how can anyone take you seriously at this point?" asked Will Sommer. "Second of all, you're clearly lying right, so what's the deal?". . "I heard - with my own ears - at least a dozen threatening calls" Burkman says. "I heard 9 or 10 hours of those calls.". . When followed up by Fischer on how Burkman would have failed to record "9 or 10 hours" of threatening calls, Burkman explained that "all of this happened very quickly.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The "Embassy Protection Collective" is comprised of groups like Codepink, ANSWER Coalition, and Popular Resistance who all share the position that Maduro is the rightful president of Venezuela and that Guaidó represented a US-backed coup. . . Supporters of the "Embassy Protection Collective" gathered outside to counter-demonstrate the pro-Guaidó activists, which occasionally escalated into violence. Early in the day, two Maduro supporters were arrested after activists from both sides came close together and scuffled over Codepink attempting to erect a tent near the pro-Guaidó folks.. . Codepink's Tighe Barry was arrested for "assaulting a police officer," but says he was pushed into the officer accusing him. A second supporter of the collective - Miranda Bachman - was also arrested. She was accused of pushing an individual during the scuffle but says she had her hands up and full at the time. Police let her go on the scene without charge.. . Hours later, officers established a police line barring off the north side of the embassy. One pro-Guaidó activist was arrested as he crossed it. . . After that, a fourth person was arrested after drugs were found. It is not currently confirmed whether she was on a particular side. As she was arrested, she attempted to head-butt officers and smashed her own head into the police van.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Today a coalition of activists including the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Party for Socialism and Libertarian (PSL) and ANSWER Coalition came together to oppose a nationalist rally expected to occur at Long Beach.. . The nationalists, who called themselves "United Patriot Nation Front" were expected to rally at Bluff Park, but never showed up.. . "They decided not to show up," one activist with PSL told News2Share. "We think that's largely because of the hard work that was done by organizers in Long Beach to mobilize community self-defense against the white nationalists.". . "Cops go home! We can handle this alone!" was among the coalition's chants. A big theme of the event was the concept of community defense rather than relying on the police, who they largely see as siding with the right wing.. . Without any nationalists present to oppose, the group used the time and platform to host their own speakers.. . "You can't come to Long Beach if you're a white nationalist... no way in hell!" said one speaker, who described white nationalism as a "remix of white supremacy.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

CODEPINK: Women For Peace, Popular Resistance, the ANSWER Coalition and other groups comprise the Embassy Protection Collective, who say they'd only leave if taken by force.. . They believe their stay is legal because they were invited by Maduro's embassy staffers, who they see as the legitimate, elected government of Venezuela.. . "We are worried that tomorrow is the day that this is gonna all come down and there will be a showdown here," said Codepink co-founder Medea Benjamin tonight. "We're not going to go lightly.

The group calls themselves the "Embassy Protection Coalition," hopes to guard against a probable takeover of the embassy by Secret Service at the direction of Juan Guaidó, an opposition leader Trump now acknowledges as the president of Venezuela.. . Since that announcement that Trump no longer recognizes Nicolás Maduro, most of the embassy staff have left, and only two remain.. . While those two plan to go willingly, many in the "Embassy Protection Coalition" are willing to risk arrest to stop the takeover.. . Attorney Mara Verheyden-Hilliard of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund spoke out on behalf of the "Embassy Protection Collective.". .

Earlier in the morning, Attorney General Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report which stated that no evidence was found of Trump or anyone in his campaign colluding with Russian agents. . . The activists focused on Barr's press conference and sections of the report that are redacted and claimed that this amounts to a "coverup." . . "We thank the Secret Service, we thank the Parks Police," they sang as usual for the cops at the event.. . "We thank the Special Council Mueller, we thank the FBI" they added to the song tonight.. . "Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!". . One activist said that Russian interference were "as if Pearl Harbor were attacked using 21st century technology" if "...there was considerable evidence that FDR were operating at the behest of the people who bombed Pearl Harbor.". . Another sang a "resistance" version of "We will rock you" at Trump:. "We will, we will stop you. Stop you.. Buddy you're a liar, traitor, sucking up to Russia, the Kochs, and the NRA..

They danced, shamed, and put three "curses" on the newly promoted Trump advisor.. . The group, which called themselves "Shmutzik Shmates," teamed up with "Werk for Peace," another DC-based organization known for dance-based political demonstrations.. . The group used dance as a form of protest, and even performed three "curses" against Miller.. . Chants included:. . -"Vern zol fun dir a blintshik un di kats zol dikh khapn - may you turn into a blintz and be snatched up by a cat.". . -"Es zol dir dunern in boykh un blitsn in di hoyzn - may you have thunder in your belly and lightning in your pants". . -"Keyn eye-hore zol im nit oysmaydn - let no evil eye avoid him. Hey hey daloy politsey! No Stephen Miller, No Fascist USA!. . -"Shande Shande Shlekht Gemit, Immigration Hypocrite (shame, shame, you cruel, malicious spirit)". . -"No Borders! No Walls! Bread & Roses for All!". . “White supremacy’s aim is to erase and destroy anything that is different than itself, and one of its most effective tools to do so is assimilation into whiteness,” said Scott Brown of Jewish Voice for Peace DC. “While Stephen Miller may have chosen to take this bait in pursuit of a position of power and influence, we as Jewish people, especially white Ashkenazi Jews, have a responsibility to call this out. It is disgraceful to use the oppression that is a part of our Jewish history as a distraction from the ways we benefit from whiteness.”. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Yang says the automation of jobs - particularly in manufacturing - led to the economic situation which caused Trump's election. He believes Trump touched on some real issues, but that he offers the opposite solutions.. . Yang emphasized his primary campaign promise: a universal basic income (UBI) which he called the "freedom dividend" where every 18+ American citizen would receive $1000 per month regardless of income level.. .

"If we don't have a free press, we don't have anything," said Cassandra Fairbanks, a journalist who recently met with Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy that ultimately turned him over to the Brits.. . "The media's become so corporate. So we really need the whistleblowers. We need the Julian Assanges. We need the Chelsea Mannings.

TV personality Lee Camp explained that Wikileaks "scares the hell out of the royal elites" which is why he believes Assange was captured.. . Assange faces a single count of conspiring with Chelsea Manning to release military information during the Obama administration. Manning herself served seven years before having her sentence commuted by President Obama.. . Despite that, Manning has been in jail for over a month for refusing to testify against Assange.

The rally - which was dubbed "We will not comply" - was in response to House Bill 228, a state law that Republicans attempted to amend to protect the right to carry certain firearms. The legislators accidentally miswrote the amendment to ban - rather than protect - the firearms in question, and the amended bill went into law.. . The ban would have been effective as of Wednesday, but emergency legislation was passed to fix the error.. . "The law in Ohio was amended, and so we need to be rejoiced in that fact," said Ryian Moore, a militia member based in Ohio. "If not, we would all be felons right now because we possess AR-15's.". . Had the erroneous bill not been fixed with emergency legislation, the event "We Will Not Comply" would have been a civil disobedience event, where the weapons they carried would be freshly illegal.. . The rallygoers numbered in the low hundreds. Approximately a dozen antifascist ("Antifa") protesters showed up to counter-demonstrate.. . Antifa said they don't oppose gun rights on principle, but took exception to the III%'er militia groups that participated in the "We Will Not Comply" coalition and the waving of a Confederate flag by one participant.. . "I don't even think if I asked any of them 'why are you here' they would have an answer," said Princess Kuevor of the counter-demonstrators. "We're here because of legislation that was attempted to be passed. Today, if they wouldn't have fixed it within the last three weeks, this would have been an act of civil disobedience. So I'm not sure why they're here.". . "I was more determined than ever to get here because nobody should have to ask to be free," added Penny Rutter, a pro-gun activist.. .

Zionism no! Israel has got to go!" Today hundreds of activists marched to AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference) to condemn Israeli influence on American foreign policy, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians.. . Meriem Abou-Ghazaleh, a young Syrian-Palestinian activist, led the march in chant this year. . . "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be Free!". . "This is not a fight against Judaism," she told News2Share. "This is a fight against Zionism, a politically corrupt ideology that literally goes against entire Jewish faith and values.". . "We demand an end to AIPAC's influence over American foreign policy," said event organizer Abbas Hamideh. "They can say it's anti-semitic, but nothing could be further from the truth.". . "We wanted to take a look at what AIPAC is and how AIPAC influences American foreign policy, not just in Palestine, but they also want to send the American people to war," Hamideh told News2Share. "We ask them to wake up and understand why AIPAC exists and how much power they have over influencing foreign policy.". . "We need to wake up and shut this place down.". . AIPAC has been consistently protested every year by the Palestinian community but tends to get the support of both Republican and Democrat politicians. While in the 2016 race only Bernie sanders declined to attend, several Democrats running for president in 2020 have declined to attend, which marks a considerable progress for the anti-AIPAC crowd.. . The issue is particularly spotlighted given Representative Ilhan Omar's comments that AIPAC influences American foreign policy because "It's all about the Benjamins, baby!". . Omar's comments were popular with protesters Sunday, some of whom quoted her and included her face on their signs.. . The event also comes in the aftermath of Donald Trump declaring Golan Heights to be rightfully owned by Israel, a decision praised by Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu but condemned by anti-Zionist activists, who see it as Syrian land occupied by Israeli forces.. .

Manning could technically be held for the full term of the grand jury, no more than 18 months.. . "We think she's taken an incredibly courage stance, saying 'no' to testifying in front of this grand jury," said Medea Benjamin, leader of Codepink.. . "We feel that there is absolutely no reason for her to be called in front of the grand jury.". . Benjamin attempted to lead the group into the jail through the visitation entrance and was stopped.. . A Deputy Sheriff told the group Manning is "in a cell by herself" pending "classification" which could take up to 72 hours.. . Benjamin asked the Deputy Sheriff whether she could tell Manning about her supporters outside, and she refused, citing policy.. . "Could you give her a little uplift?" Benjamin insisted.. . "No ma'am," said the Deputy Sheriff.. . "We treat everyone here well," she claimed, when Codepink expressed their concern.. . A Lieutenant came out to tell the pro-Manning activists that they "are blocking the gate right here and cars are coming in" and that the activists would have to stand across the street.. . No cars went in or out the entire time that the group was there.. . "We'll get more folks the next time, and we'll try to organize so that we can go inside and visit Chelsea," Benjamin said before leaving. "We'll be back.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The event was not formally part of CPAC.. . Wohl handed out an eight-page press release entitled "Confidential Report: Investigation of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) that essentially accuses the congresswoman of marrying her own brother.. . A press release ahead of time described the event's location vaguely, and News2Share's Ford Fischer showed up a moment late to film. The video attached is unedited but begins a bit after Wohl began speaking to a crowd of CPAC attendees and a handful of press.. . Wohl handed out a press release to the media labeled "privileged and strictly confidential" but confirmed that he wanted it to be read and reported on. The full press release can be viewed here:. https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1101237710101118979. . Most of the press’s questions pertained to Wohl’s previous attempt to hurt accuse Mueller of sexual assault. His and Burkman’s retort was to say “we’re focused on Rep Omar right now.”. . Wohl was recently banned from Twitter after USA Today reported that "He says he plans to create “enormous left-wing online properties” – such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts – "and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.”". . He joins Loomer who also is banned from Twitter.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Students March in France Against Macron, Tuition Prices</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Feb 14, 2019</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Today French students held their own "Acte I," or first demonstration amidst the Yellow Vest movement. The group carried many of the same goals as the Yellow Vests, but specifically focused on the subject of rising tuition costs in France.. . "Emmanuel Macron, Edouard Philippe, Michel Blanquer, Frederique Vidal, and all of them represent and impose a racist, violent, discriminatory and unequal society with flashbangs and tear gas!" said their group's statement, published before the march. . . "Against the reform of the baccalaureate, parcoursup, the paying university for extra-community students, against the liberal and elitist laws that aim to cash in the knowledge, the youth enters in resistance!". . The group had a strong left-wing persuasion, flaunting communist symbols, signs promoting Marxism, and frequent chants of "anti-capitalista!". . "For a new educational system, a university open to all. For the end of the competition of high schools and universities. For a cosmopolitan country where knowledge comes before profit, youth goes on the offensive!". . The group departed from the forecourt of Censier and headed toward a government building where they were deterred by police in riot control gear. The group about about 100 students marched down the street, once being turned around by police again.. . Eventually the group split into two directions unintentionally, and police charged between the two sides to split their group in half. The protest dissolved from there.. . Given that this was only their "Acte I," further demonstrations are expected.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Despite threats from police, the group demands that Macron fulfill his promises to solve homelessness and refuses to surrender the building until he does. . . The Roquépine Gymnasium, a health center in a wealthy part of Paris, not far from the presidential palace. The group, which calls itself "droit au logement" ("right to housing") rallied outside the gym Wednesday night, drawing attention for their cause. . . "We hold the occupation until the state takes on its responsibilities" to help people, one organizer told News2Share. "Pressure is building for us to leave, but we won't leave until we have a solution.". . ""We've received some threats yesterday from the authorities, but we don't have any solution," another said. "They are not proposing any solution for the people which are homeless which are defended by us.". . France offers that individuals with "social emergencies" such as housing or food insecurity can dial 115 to receive assistance, but the activists with droit au logement say that this has been ineffective during the Macron presidency.. . "Macron promised us to shelter people already two years ago. Now the situation is totally the same.

Police pushed back against the 50,000 person crowd, often escalating into violence including tear gas, pepper spray, batons and flash grenades. In previous weeks, rubber bullets and water cannons had also been deployed.. . One activist lost his hand after a GLI-F4 grenade deployed by police exploded in his immediate vicinity.. . GLI-F4 is a tear gas grenade that includes 25 grams of TNT and has been banned in all European nations except for France.. . The protest itself boasted many different factions, from the reactionary right to the far left. One antifa group wielded communist iconography and dressed in black bloc. In addition to fighting police, this particular contingency participated in property destruction, such as smashing ATM’s and bank windows, and burning expensive cars and police vehicles.. . The common unifying theme was a rejection of neoliberal capitalism and President Emmanuel Macron.. . “He is the president of the rich, and he forgets all the poor people,” one Yellow Vest activist told News2Share.. . “Neoliberalism = fascism,” one protester’s sign read, complete with photos of Hitler and Pinochet with Macron’s face photoshopped into them.. . The fighting dissolved after a particularly violent scuffle near the Eiffel Tower led to the destruction of multiple police vehicles, the deployment of GLI-F4 grenades, and several injured and arrested protesters.. . A total of at least ten people were reportedly arrested throughout the day.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer.. .

The event dubbed "Rock Stone Mountain" had been planned for months and was expected to attract white nationalist activists, but was cancelled right before taking place. The antifa coalition, which donned the name FLOWER (stands for “Frontline organizations working together to end racism,”) stuck with their original plan to assemble outside the park.. . The park itself had announced Friday night that it wouldn't allow anyone inside.. . FLOWER's coalition included communists, socialists, unions, armed leftist groups (such as Redneck Revolt, John Brown Gun Club, and Socialist Rifle Association), and other left-wing activists.. . The group marched around the Stone Mountain community as a "victory lap" for the cancelled right-wing event.. . “The nightmare scenario is that somebody decides to be a lone wolf and pulls something like what happened in Charlottesville,” an organizer who wished to be identified as “Firebug” said before the event. To that end, the group had left-wing militia groups with long rifles and shotguns act as a roving perimeter around the demonstration.. . The activists stopped at the Stone Mountain visitor center, where the demanded that authorities "sand blast Stone Mountain!" They then produced an effigy of a Ku Klux Klan member, complete with a swastika on its chest, which they lit on fire.. . Activist Molly "@socialistdogmom" lit her cigarette on the makeshift campfire.. . After antifa finished their burning, police came and extinguished the remains. Other than that brief involvement, police mostly took a hands-off approach to the demonstration, declining to interfere or make arrests. . . One masked activist gave a speech at the end of his event, noting that antifa's American roots from 2017 anti-Milo Yiannopoulos protests at Berkeley "have blossomed into a full-stemmed revolutionary flower" and that the white nationalist no-show was proof of their power.. . "You can't just talk tough, you have to walk it," said Christopher Goad. Based in Virginia, Goad participated in counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville as well. "We weren't looking for enemies. We weren't starting fights. If the presence that we had was enough to deter anything that happened, then that's what happened.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

News2Share stopped by the demonstration to hear their case.. . "They were born this way. They should stay this way. It's not like some birth defect," said one woman who said she's a trained nurse, holding a sign that reads "Circumcision is child abuse.". . "Everybody has a right to their own body," said Harry Guiremand, who works with "Bloodstained Men & Their Friends." "If you cut off a part of a non-consenting person's body, you have committed an assault.". . The group mostly wore all-white outfits with a fake bloodstain on their crotch.. . "We're wearing the wound to shock the public. Because if we were out here protesting female genital mutilation wearing a bloodstain, everyone would be like 'yes! Obviously that is so wonderful!'" one activist remarked. "But for some reason men turn their backs on boys." . . "There is no mother or father that should be able to make a decision about how a man's dick functions or what it looks like. That should be his decision," another added.. . "It's the beginning of rape culture," one female activist noted. "In a lot of ways, circumcision is rape by instrumentation, but also amputation of a body part without consent.". . Additional conversations are in this video, and a recording of News2Share's entire time at the event can be viewed here: https://www.facebook.com/N2Sreports/videos/348866179040094/. . Later in the day when News2Share wasn't on the scene, two men allegedly grabbed and bent the group's signs and threw them in a trash can. . . The two were chased down and reportedly asked to stand by while police came to the scene. After offering an apology, one reimbursed the activists $8 for the destroyed sign.. . https://www.facebook.com/brotherk.bloodstainedman/posts/1209777412512744. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Blocking bridges and sitting-in on the Houses of Parliament, Extinction Rebellion now boasts chapters in 35 countries around the world, including 30 in the U.S.. .

With 800,000 people poised to miss their second paycheck, unions representing federal employees packed into the atrium of the Hart Senate building. The hundreds that turned out carried styrofoam plates symbolizing thousands of furloughed workers and the undue financial burdens they say have befallen their families as the shutdown drags on.. . “We are here today to tell the United States Senate and Senate Majority leader McConnell that it’s time to stop holding 800,000 federal employees, thousands of federal contractors and the American people financially hostage,” read a flier passed out by union representatives in the Hart building.. . In what union organizers called “Occupy Hart,” hundreds stood in silence for 33 minutes — one minute for every day of the shutdown thus far, the passing of each minute marked with a lone chime in an otherwise dead quiet atrium. After the half-hour had passed, the group erupted in a chant of “no more food banks, we need paychecks,” before falling silent again to avoid arrest in coordination with Capitol police.. . "The president's actions are exposing us. The president's actions are making us vulnerable at the border," Representative Jamie Raskin told the media. He contends that President Trump is hurting national security and faith in government itself with the shutdown.. . "Open up this government now!" demanded J. David Cox, National President of the American Federation of Government Employees. "Pay the workers. I mean it's fine for a man that have billions of dollars to not understand what it means to be paycheck to paycheck. But forcing workers to go to work without pay is unconscionable." . . An unknown number of protesters were arrested during a subsequent sit-in outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office in a neighboring building. In a live stream on Facebook, a small group of protesters can be heard chanting “where is Mitch” while being led away by Capitol police.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

American constitutional militia groups operate independently of one another, but stay in contact to maintain common goals and ideals over time.. . ERAM was convened January 19th at an undisclosed location in Virginia, where 11 groups from 9 states (Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina) assembled to discuss goals for 2019.. . Two representatives from left-wing militia groups also attended, but wished to remain off-camera and off-record for the duration of the recording.. . Overall, the groups agreed on three primary shared goals. The first was community out reach. The militias intend to each hold town hall meetings with their respective communities that remain as apolitical as possible and focus on local issues.. . Secondly, the groups plan to develop a mutual aid network for relief during natural disaster situations. During 2017 and 2018, militia groups responded to several natural disasters, but they agreed that additional preparation and coordination work could be done ahead of these situations to handle them most smoothly, and without the help of FEMA or the Red Cross.. . Lastly, the groups hoped to push Second Amendment outreach into communities without a strong firearms presence, particularly minority communities.. . Those in attendance included:. .

Carrying a confederate flag, he was confronted by Don Folden, the founder "DC Black Tours.". . The disagreement went on for about three minutes, and mostly focused around the subject of slavery and the confederacy. Folden insisted that Kessler meet with him to learn black history, given Kessler's affinity for Confederate iconography. . . Two months later, Kessler's "Unite the Right" rally took place in Charlottesville, leaving three dead.. . Folden has since then continued to establish his business, even being profiled by the Washington Post for not "shying away from the painful parts of DC's black history.". . https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/this-tour-guide-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-painful-parts-of-dcs-black-history/2018/06/04/d6bc2a48-53a8-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html. . On Sunday, Folden and Kessler met for that conversation. The two sat down outside Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, a site used as a stop on the Underground Railroad.. . The two intended to have a discussion, which often wavered into debate. ABC7's Sam Ford and News2Share's Ford Fischer were the two journalists in attendance. . . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

"Well I think we all have a mutual responsibility to take care of our public spaces, and government doesn't necessarily need to pay for that," said Ethan Bishop-Henchman. "And it's definitely not paying for it right now.". . "Libertarians are obviously about reducing the size of government," explained Jess Mears, membership manager of the Libertarian Party. "Obviously, the federal government does maintain the parks. While it is shut down right now, we're trying to exemplify other ways that we could have these services without federal dollars contributing to them.". . "It's an example of us practicing what we preach. We want the private sector to step up when government can't, so that's what we're doing here," added Joe Bishop-Henchman, the Chair of DC's Libertarian Party.. . In total, the group accumulated dozens of garbage bags full of trash across the National Mall, which required two vehicles to cart away to a dump site.. . "We got quite a haul here, it's even a little bit more than I was expecting," said Adam Theo, Chair of the Libertarian Party of Northern Virginia.

Jovi Val, a former member of the Proud Boys, said that the event was called "Justice isn't Blind" because, as he sees is, nationalists are treated more harshly by the criminal justice system.. . He cited the sentence of life plus 419 years James Alex Fields received for the car attack in Charlottesville, the indictment of multiple Rise Above Movement members for conspiracy to riot, and the indictment of nine Proud Boys for gang assault for a violent situation in New York as examples.. . "Dwayne Dixon should have been tried as an accessory to it," said Gabriel Brown, referencing a UNC professor that James Fields' defense called as a witness. Dixon was affiliated with the left wing and armed with a rifle in Charlottesville.. . The Proud Boys group has condemned Jovi and his event unequivocally.. . Antifa threw water balloons filled with paint at the group. One was arrested on site, while two others were chased down and arrested. A fourth antifa-affiliated individual attempted to take Val's "Make America Great Again" cap and was handcuffed face-down on the ground by police. Val said he intends to press charges against all four.. . "They hate this flag. They hate this hat. They hate this president. They hate themselves," said Val of antifa. "Next time we go to a rally, instead of holding signs, we should hold mirrors so they can look at themselves.. . Hazmats were called to the scene to confirm the contents of the water balloons.. . Police established a heavy perimeter around the"Justice isn't Blind" event, which spent about two hours in a verbal back-and-forth with antifa. The remainder of the event was peaceful.. . As rain began falling, police extracted the group with a bicycle squad and escorted them into an Uber SUV.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Women's March co-founder Bob Bland also attended the event and closed it out with a reflection on the Women's March and how her movement plans to work in the future. . . Bland discussed how the Women's March movement has expanded beyond two large marches and into resistance - for example - to the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Bland said that she welcomes and encourages a diverse range of positions and voices within the women's march movement, specifically pointing out that she wants anti-war groups like "CODEPINK: Women for Peace" to challenge them. . .

According to WJBF, Stachowiak was a police officer until 2008 when his license was revoked for misconduct.. . https://www.wjbf.com/news/volunteer-armed-guard-has-criminal-past-police-experience_20180307063619785/1015809265. . “Attack me, you’ll get a bullet in your head," he told antifa. "I’m not threatening. I’m telling you what the consequences of an attack would be.”. . Police stood between Stachowiak's group and the counter-demonstrators as the words were exchanged.. . News2Share's Ford Fischer and Sarah Shoemaker covered the event, and while virtually no violence occurred, Stachowiak was ardent in his intentions to use lethal force if provoked.. . http://news2share.com/start/2018/12/16/antifa-face-off-with-confederates-at-unc-chapel-hill/. . “I am a proud American confederate Patriot,” Stachowiak told News2Share after the event. “And I know what’s coming. It’s a civil war coming by these people and they keep pushing buttons… when they make their final and stupid move, it’ll be the last stupid move they ever make.”. . https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1074463519989481472. . You can see the full event and the interview's entirety on News2Share's livestream of the event.. . https://www.facebook.com/N2Sreports/videos/2321553991423748/. . Since the event, Stachowiak has posted a number of videos featuring himself armed and threatening to commit violence against antifa, always with the clarification of "when they attack.". . The videos, which caught the attention of the SPLC, led to Stachowiak's removal from Youtube. The group he protested alongside in North Carolina has also disavowed him.. . https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/12/20/longtime-antigovernment-militia-organizer-calls-lone-wolf-action-against-antifa. . Stachowiak called News2Share Friday morning unexpectedly. Editor-in-chief Ford Fischer picked up and began recording a couple minutes into the conversation, which can be listened to in full. While both Washington DC and Georgia (where Fischer and Stachowiak were speaking from respectively) both have one-party consent to record telephone conversations, Fischer verified with Stachowiak that he was fine being recorded.. . Stachowiak primarily tried to reiterate that his armed videos were meant to intimidate enemies of his who "plan to cause tremendous bodily harm." In the past, he's called for lethal force against antifa, Muslims, looters, and Black Lives Matter.. . "And I'm not the only one who feels this way in this country," he added.. . "Unite against Islam. Islams are the devil," he once said in a 2015 recording according to WJBF.. . "Islam is not a religion," he claimed to News2Share. "It's an ideology.". . He disagrees with the SPLC referring to him as "anti-government" because "we support the police," he explained.. . "We're building cells," he claimed. In his view, small cells and preparation for "lone wolf" acts of violence are necessary, but he included and reiterated a qualifier.. . "At the present point where we're at, the police have the ability to control the violence if they act on it," he said. "I'm talking about if it's so out of control that the police and the national guard are not able to control it.". . "We're in a civil war," he added. "It just hasn't gone full-throttle.". . In addition to an apocalyptic view of war with the left, Stachowiak pointed out the conditions in which the state itself could become his target.. . "Armed conflict is the answer to gun confiscation," he said, explaining that he'd call for attacks on politicians in the event of wide-scale gun control.. . "At the end of the day, the police are the enforcement arm of the state," Fischer pointed out.. . "Would I advocate going to war with the police and even our own government in a state of national gun confiscation?" he asked himself out loud. "The answer would be 'yes.'". .

Fuck the confederacy! 4! 5! 6! Fuck the confederacy!" antifa shouted at pro-confederate activitsts at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill today. The activists came to campus to support "Silent Sam," a confederate statue that had been torn down earlier this year.. . Silent Sam supporters gathered at the university's McCorkle Place at noon, where antifa groups confronted them and attempted to block cameras with signs, banners, and music in an effort to "deplatform" their protest.. . "This has been happening all year. We've been getting violent neo-confederate and neo-nazi groups," said graduate student Lindsay Ayling. "A lot of the same people that were at Unite the Right in Charlottesville come to our campus because love this racist statue.". . While the event remained peaceful on both sides, antifa's actions put confederate activist James Stachowiak on edge. "You ever try to attack me, I'll put you in your grave," he said on his way out of UNC. "Attack me, you'll get a bullet in your head. I'm not threatening. I'm telling you what the consequences of an attack would be.". . "I am a proud American confederate Patriot," Stachowiak told News2Share after the event. "And I know what's coming. It's a civil war coming by these people and they keep pushing buttons... when they make their final and stupid move, it'll be the last stupid move they ever make.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

"Taxation is theft!" In the era of Trump, street activism has generally become divisive, and centered on conflict between the ideological left and right. One movement that has attempted to sidestep the division is the "Million Mask March," an annual anti-corruption event that takes place in cities throughout the world since 2013.. . The event drew some activists who are now members of the "antifa movement," while others personally support President Trump. Organizers used the 2018 march to focus on common values (equality and freedom) and common enemies (the Church of Scientology, the Federal Reserve, and the government itself). . . Originally, the group was founded as a street wing of Anonymous, an online hacker activist collective.. . While some tense moments occurred between the sometimes-smoke-bomb-wielding activists and cars they blocked on the street, the event remained generally peaceful and upbeat. . .

According to the Stop Police Terror Project, the D.C.-based organizer behind Monday’s march, Oct. 22 has seen nationwide marches highlighting policy brutality and officer-involved violence against minority communities since 1996. This year’s march comes about one month after the death of Botham Jean, shot by a Dallas police officer whom, she claims, thought him as an intruder in an apartment she mistook as hers.. . The group first stopped at a bar called Penn Social where Mayor Muriel Bowser was holding an event. The group chanted to confront her for "law and order" and "mass incarceration" policies despite the appearance of progressivism.. . The group then marched to the new Law Enforcement Museum where local activist Natacia Knapper spoke out. She had an early tour of as part of a story for Al Jazeera. Her conclusion? It's "copaganda” that paints police as reformed, minimizes militarization and erases Black Lives Matter.. . In a news release, the Stop Police Terror Project listed victims they said were victims of recent aggression at the hands of the Metropolitan Police Department, Metro Transit Police and other regional law enforcement agencies. Among them were 22-year-old Jeffrey Price and 24-year-old D’Quan, both killed by D.C. in the last year — the latter, D’Quan, shot to death near a recreation center.. . The Stop Police Terror Project describes itself as an organization “committed to changing the system of racist, militarized policing in DC and beyond.” The group originally organized under the name DCFerguson, in response to a national outcry following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.. . Having since rebranded themselves with a more specific focus on police violence in D.C., they now seek to tie national police issues into a set of local proposals. Their list of demands as an organization include: . . "-Militarized Policing must end immediately.. -Communities should be empowered to secure themselves.. -As long as the police are an institution, there must be clear accountability mechanisms in the hands of the people.. -The issue of militarized policing and mass incarceration are military solutions to the social problems in oppressed communities, which is a form of social control. As such critiquing capitalism is a necessary part of our movement.. -We are opposed to patriarchy and all racism, bigotry, homophobia and transphobia.. -Our movement is broad and unity is important. We believe in exploring with all who wish to partner the issue of limited unity around police terror but our basic point of unity with all forces is a forthright recognition of the importance of LGBTQ and Women freedom fighters to at all times be respected and safe.". . Monday night’s protest specifically condemned police violence, but also added that “violent imagery and logos and ongoing attempts to hide data on clearly racist police practices” exacerbated the problems being focused on, according to the group’s press release.. .

For the National Center for Transgender Equality and likeminded transgender rights activists, the details of a draft memo revealed in a New York Times article on Sunday night are a worst-case scenario. The Times reported on an effort within the Department of Health and Human Services to form a strict, government-wide definition of gender as defined during birth by the genitalia of the newborn.. . If that effort came to a head, it would effectively strip federal civil rights protections from about 1.4 million Americans who identify as a gender other than the one they were born into — effectively, as activists are fearing, erasing recognization of transgenderism from federal policy.. .

Yet, she was almost taken into custody on Friday — twice.. Benjamin and about thirty other people spent Friday afternoon on the march in downtown D.C. over the apparent death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi, in CODEPINK’s view, fell victim to both a Saudi hit job and gross negligence from the Trump administration, whom the group sees as eager to let the whole thing slide if it means preserving a regional ally.. . For CODEPINK activists, Mohammad Bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, is an autocratic ruler whose human rights abuses are enabled by U.S. arms deals and military aid. CODEPINK has been protesting Saudi foreign policy for years, calling on international sanctions on the world’s last absolute monarchy over civilian casualties in Yemen.. . But it was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s recent meeting with the prince, together with Trump’s suggestion that Khashoggi has been slain not on Saudi order but by “rogue killers,” that had angered activists who marched on Friday.. . “It’s disgusting for Secretary of State Pompeo to be cozying up to murderers,” Benjamin said in a media statement on Thursday. “Instead, Pompeo, along with President Trump, should be expressing outrage at this barbarous act and implementing appropriate responses, including cutting weapons sales and imposing sanctions on those involved, including the top leadership.”. . Seeking to pressure White House and State Department officials into a tougher response, CODEPINK members addressed Pompeo in a petition demanding answers for Khashoggi’s death, sanctions against the kingdom and an end to military ties.. . “This is the Saudi Monarchy, this is their nature,” said Ali al-Ahmed, an activist who marched with CODEPINK on Friday. “Murdering people in the most gruesome way is in the DNA of the Saudi government.". . Friday’s agenda, Benjamin told News2Share was simple: March to the State Department on Constitution Avenue, meet with a representative and deliver the single page petition. Things didn’t exactly go according to plan.. . To Benjamin’s dismay, CODEPINK found themselves face-to-face with a line of police at the State Department, who denied knowledge of any communication beforehand over a petition delivery. Benjamin asked her group to sit-in on the agency’s driveway, refusing to move until they’d either be let inside, or a representative would come out to accept their delivery.. . In an hour-long wait, Department of Homeland Security police threatened to arrest Benjamin and CODEPINK activist Ariel Gold who stood on a ledge and repeated their demand . . Eventually, a public affairs representative accepted the petition from Gold, to cheers of “hallelujah” from protesters. . . With the petition delivered, the next stop was a short march away at the Saudi Embassy, where the situation again got unexpectedly tense. . . “We sat down very peacefully on the steps here, and they went ballistic,” Benjamin said, after being abruptly cuffed by one of several guards who blocked protesters off from the embassy proper.. . The officer – a contractor with private firm United American Security – forcibly lifted Benjamin off the step only seconds after a verbal warning. He released Benjamin after she pleaded to be freed.. . "We know who should get the handcuffs. Anybody working for the Saudi Embassy should get the handcuffs. Shame," said Benjamin afterwards. . . The officer, who wore no visible name badges, later declined to identify himself. . . United American Security has not yet responded to a News2Share request for comment.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer.

The right wing groups, which included Proud Boys, American Guard, Boston Free Speech, and Resist Marxism, intended to rally from noon to 2pm. . . "We have to whoop antifa, and we have to support free speech," said one activist dressed head to toe as Spiderman.. . Antifa used white paint as a weapon first, covering both police and right-wingers. As clashed continued between the two sides, urine was also deployed from a bottle toward Proud Boys and press.. . "Fascists, go home!" antifa chanted at the group, particularly honing in on Joey Gibson, the founder of Patriot Prayer.. . A few major scuffles broke out, causing both sides to use fists and clubs, while antifa also deployed at least two smoke grenades and at least one individual deployed mace.. . Police stood by during the clashes, watching closely without intervening, until they declared the entire event unlawful, and gave activists on all sides ten minutes to disburse. . . "They didn't do a damn thing," Joey Gibson said of the police. "Except kick us out.". . "We asked them, we said 'hey, this is the hecklers' veto. This is how the opposition shuts this down,'" said organizer Samson Racioppi. "So they let us have some speakers but the whole time it was just out of control. There was constant violence in the protesters. We never got to have all the people who came here to see our people speak, to have them speak.". . "They ordered us to leave, and we obliged because we didn't want to make a bad situation worse.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Hundreds of Washingtonians held candles and shared their experiences with sexual assault at the foot of the Supreme Court as the sun set over a country holding its breath for days to come. According to organizer MoveOn, it was the flagship vigil of almost 300 similar events in public spaces and outside courthouses from Anchorage to Miami, all geared at supporting survivors of assault and staunchly opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the highest court in the land despite mounting allegations of assault.. . For vigil-goers, the stakes are higher now more than ever. Even before Dr. Christine Blasey Ford went public, pro-abortion groups including Planned Parenthood Action and NARAL Pro-Choice America campaigned against Kavanaugh for his unclear stance on Roe v. Wade. Others, including Senate Democrats, took issue with the judge’s past comments on executive power.. . But what was once a focus on abortion rights and executive power have exploded into a broader outcry against more than just Kavanaugh. For the countless protesters who have staked out the halls of Senate offices for weeks, the embattled judge’s alleged treatment of women in his high school and college years represent the worst that conservatism has to offer for women’s rights.. . For Kavanaugh’s supporters, it’s a foothold against a rising tide of liberal values and high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct in the #MeToo era. At a media gaggle on Tuesday, President Trump said obstacles to Kavanaugh’s nomination are proof of a “very scary time for young men in America.. . And at a campaign rally that followed, Trump seemingly mocked Dr. Blasey Ford’s recollection of an event she says happened decades ago. Thousands of enthralled supporters — both men and women — cheered him on. Senators Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins — three votes that could make or break Kavanaugh’s nomination — all pushed back, but none indicated Trump’s comments would be a factor in their final decision.. .

The group, flying under the new banner of "#WeDoNotConsent," sought to protest the broader Trump agenda, but particularly Judge Brett Kevanaugh's potential appointment to the Supreme Court.. . "We're here today because we oppose Trump's power grab on the Supreme Court," said Duncin Meisel, an activist with By the People. "His effort to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court despite very credible sexual assault allegations is an effort to prove that powerful men do not have to be held accountable for their actions, and we are here to say we do not consent to that.". . "We do not consent to a government run by abusers and their enablers," he added.. . Alexandra Flores-Quilty, Campaign Lead with By the People was one of the people arrested at the entrance of the White House.. . "Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump are both desperate to prove the same thing: that powerful men will not be held accountable for their actions," Flores-Quilty said. "We demand a shut-down of Trump's power grabs until the election, and call on millions of Americans to join us to make it happen."  . .

Kent State alumna Kaitlin Bennett - best known as the "Kent State Gun Girl" - returned to her former campus Saturday afternoon with hundreds of activists including gun-owners and militiamen. The group, affiliated with right-libertarian organization Liberty Hangout, wanted to draw attention to Kent State's ban on students carrying firearms on their campus, despite the general public's ability to do so.. . The group was confronted by hundreds of activists with Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and other groups. . . "We don't need police, because we are gun owners obviously. But it's helpful that they're here just to keep them under control," Bennett told News2Share, pointing at the counter-demonstrators.. . "We just don't think fascists should be welcome, basically. If you're using hate speech, we're not ok with that," one activist with antifa told News2Share. "We think it's distasteful to have a gun rally at a school that had a gun massacre.". . The antifa specifically noted the participation of The Proud Boys to brand Kaitlin's group as "Hate Speech." The Proud Boys describe themselves as “western chauvinists” and deny claims of being a hate group.. . Hundreds of police officers, many in riot gear, kept the two sides separate. As the march moved into campus, counter-demonstrators frequently attempted to block their path. Violence occasionally broke out, leaving at least one injured and four arrested.. . "The police had no choice but to escort the group back to the parking lot and protect them so they could leave unharmed," said Ezry Bennett (no relation to Kaitlin Bennett) who contributed his video reporting to News2Share.. . "I think what the counter protesters have done is show who the left really is, and what their goals are. It's to silence the right-wing voice," she said.. . Filmed by Ezry Bennett. .

The Women’s March and the Center for Popular Democracy spearheaded a mass arrest action to kick off a week of protests in support of Dr. Ford, whose allegations against the Supreme Court nominee have sparked turmoil.. . With more at least one other allegation surfacing and the Senate Judiciary Committee voting on Thursday, activists — many of whom are back protesting Capitol Hill after campaigning against health care and tax reform — are hopeful that undecided members of Congress will hear them out.. . “She called for more information and more hearings,” a staffer for Maine Senator Susan Collins told a protester. On Monday morning, the Women’s March-led action had split into three groups, each visiting the Washington offices of Senators Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Ben Sasse.. . “She has information he’s a sexual predator,” the group’s leader replied, “If she’s not ready to commit to a ‘no,’ we’ll have to shut this office down.” Moments later, Capitol police moved in to cuff a group of protesters who ceaselessly sang “we believe Dr. Ford, we believe Deborah Ramirez, we believe Anita Hill” — the latter, a callback to Justice Clarence Thomas’ accuser upon his nomination in 1991.. . Collins, Flake and Sasse are all Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which — assuming Kavanaugh doesn’t withdraw — will ultimately have to vote on advancing his nomination to the Senate. Collins and Flake have wavered in recent days from unilateral support of Kavanaugh.. . Sasse, in particular, was a roped into today’s protests after Sunday’s New Yorker article revealing a second allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, this time during his freshman year at Yale University. Sasse earned his doctorate from Yale in 2004.. . After office visits, protesters took to the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building to share their experiences with sexual assault and fears about facing repercussions for speaking out. The group, numbering in the hundreds, mostly wore black in an act of solidarity with Dr. Ford. Among protest-sanctioned garbs of “Be a Hero” and “Believe Women,” were sport apparel from Yale.. . “I have not been raped myself, but I will fight with everything I have to make sure we change this culture where women are disbelieved, persecuted, received receive death threats, assaulted,” one protester, a mother to a young daughter, to a circle of people gathered around her. “That’s unacceptable, and it won’t happen to my daughter — I’ll fight with everything I have.”. . Front-and-center in the group was 34-year-old activist Ady Barkan, a lawyer whose leadership of similar protests against Republican health care reform elevated him to a position of prominence and respect among progressive activists. Barkan suffers from ALS, an incurable neurodegenerative disease — but a year on from his fight against the health care bill, he’s back on Capitol Hill.. . “Cis men have a crucial role to play. We must stop committing violence and stop violence when we see it,” he said. Due to his disease, a fellow demonstrator stood by Barkan and read out his written statement.. . After a final round of arrests saw most of the group arrested in the rotunda, Barkan was one of the last to go.. . With Dr. Ford and Kavanaugh set to make an appearance before the judiciary committee this Thursday, the week is looking to be a busy one for activists. In addition to Monday’s action on Capitol Hill, MoveOn.org and NARAL Pro-Choice America joined the Women’s March in calling for a nationwide walkout from schools and places of work for an hour on Monday afternoon in support of Dr. Ford.. . The Women’s March itself is planning another round of protest on Capitol Hill during Thursday’s hearing.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Kuhn, who identifies as an anarchist, was sent a federal grand jury subpoena demanding “all recorded images, audio and data of protests near the White House, in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 2018, between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., that are contained in a hand-held, Canon, flip-screen camera, with a black hand strap, that you possessed within the District of Columbia on August 12, 2018.”. . At the time period described, Kuhn was filming antifa counter-protests against Jason Kessler’s “Unite the Right 2” sequel to last year’s Charlottesville protest that turned deadly. . . Kuhn stood outside the courthouse as he was originally instructed to appear inside.. . “I am refusing to comply with this grand jury subpoena,” Kuhn told the press. “I will not betray my own people. To comply with this would be a negation of my entire life’s work. No how, no way.”. . “We will not be intimidated by the state. We will not comply with grand juries,” added Lacy MacAuley, an organizer with DC’s antifa movement. “Our comrade does not intend to report for questioning or turn over any footage. The comrade does so at risk of bodily safety: The state can imprison people for an indefinite period of time for resisting a grand jury subpoena. We will not submit.”. . “United States District Court federal grand jury, this is what I think of your subpoena,” Kuhn said before lighting a copy on fire.. . “Fuck grand juries,” the group chanted, as they marched to a second nearby courthouse. Kuhn burned a second copy of the subpoena. . . As the group began to depart, Kuhn received a call from his attorney. . . “The subpoena has been withdrawn. They have given up. They have thrown in the towel. We have won. They have lost. Any questions?” Kuhn declared. . . “So you just have to set it on fire and it’s cancelled?” News2Share’s Ford Fischer asked sarcastically. . . “Pretty much,” Kuhn said. He went on to explain that how his lawyer argued successfully against the subpoena’s legitimacy. . . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The event was held on the National Mall in Washington D.C with a humble crowd of 200 conservatives, apolitical observers, and the occasional juggalo. Event organizers for this year’s rally hoped for a larger turn out than last year to emulate the ambitious goal of creating a “Woodstock for Trump Supporters.”. . There were no counter protesters, nor any tense situations with law enforcement. Oathkeeper and III% groups acted as security, vastly outnumbering Parks Police. . . Notable guest speakers included Republican party consultant Roger Stone and conservative personalities such as Ace Baker, Ashton Whitty, and Joey Gibson.. . "He should fire Jeff Jessions. He should send the Keebler elf, the insubordinate hillbilly back to Alabama. He should fire Rod Rosenstein," Stone said of President Trump. "And then, he should fire Mr Mueller.

"We must fight and the first fight is to postpone this nomination hearing," Senator Blumenthal told the crowd.. . Lilly Ledbetter - the plaintiff in the employment discrimination case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. - also spoke out. "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against equal pay. A vote for Kavanaugh is a vote against #MeToo and #TimesUp.," she said. "A vote for Kavanaugh is a vote against every working man and woman in our country.". . "We need our senators to stand up and vote "no" against this judge, because he is going to harm this country, and he is going to harm women," explained Senator Gillibrand to the crowd.. . "I think women's rights, gay rights, oversight, accountability, and ending the culture of corruption will be a lot harder," she told News2Share when asked what is at stake if Kavanaugh is confirmed.. . "Working women are rising up and speaking out against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Time and again, Kavanaugh has ruled against working people, especially those pursuing employment discrimination claims and trying to join together in a union," it said on the protest's event description. "So much is on the line with Kavanaugh’s nomination, including our ability to hold our harassers accountable, to achieve equal pay, to fight pregnancy discrimination, and to organize for our rights at work. We can’t let Kavanaugh have a lifetime seat on the highest court.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. Tyler Yzaguirre contributed to this report. .

The group clarified that they're "against all political violence," but that they believe it predominantly comes from the left today. Dozens of Boston Police surrounded the group, protecting them from the hundreds of antifascist activists that attempted to confront them.. . After rallying for about an hour without any violence, the group marched with police protection to the "T" (Boston's subway) where they traveled to Bunker Hill, meeting with the "blue bloc" along the way. The "blue bloc" is a group of "Boston Free Speech" activists who wear all blue and conceal their identities, mimicking antifa's "black bloc" style. They say that the tactic is used to prevent doxxing.. . At Bunker Hill, a few activists spoke, and one (who is also a cannabis legalization advocate) Samson Racciopi, lit up a joint. The group was confronted by only a few counter-demonstrators at Bunker Hill and was able to leave uneventfully.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

From dawn to dusk, a broad collective of left-wing groups — most recognizably Black Lives Matter, the ANSWER Coalition, and the Democratic Socialists of America — spearheaded a community-led effort to confront the Unite the Right revival. Arguably, months of organizing ultimately paid off: for every one of Kessler's compatriots, it seemed there were one hundred protesters parading and singing through the streets just a block away.. . Hours before Kessler and his group set off for the White House, crowds gradually grew at Freedom Plaza and the northern half of Lafayette Square. Led by the Shut It Down DC collective and the ANSWER Coalition, respectively, these two rallies formed the foundation for what would later swell into a single zone of protest from the edges of Foggy Bottom to 15th Street.. . The Freedom Plaza event, titled "DC United Against Hate," featured speakers personally threatened by acts of racism and white supremacy — including protesters attacked by attendees of the original Unite the Right in Charlottesville last year. “This kind of violence follows you,” said one protester who had been assaulted in a Charlottesville parking garage. “In reality, it’s woven into the fabric of our history.” That incident resulted in a conviction earlier this year.. . A ten minute walk away at Lafayette Square, hundreds of protesters actively watched over the barricaded southern half of the park for the impending arrival of the new Unite the Right. Chalk messages on the H Street sidewalk held the full names and phone numbers of people their authors outed as white supremacists. As the day passed, over a thousand people packed up to the edge of the mazelike security perimeter, sometimes stepping into off-limits gardens for more breathing room. As Kessler's rally arrived, the chant of choice was short and decisive: "Go home, Nazi scum.". . With an hour to go, the local Black Lives Matter chapter gathered hundreds on their own for a march beginning just north of Lafayette Square. Out of the dozens of groups organizing Sunday's counterprotests, Black Lives Matter DC proved one of the most vocal. On news of a white supremacist rally in their city, local organizers canvassed neighborhoods in southeast and northeast Washington — public housing, grocery stores, barber shops — and quickly spread out to hold the line along the northern perimeter of Lafayette Square.. . Antifa and other black bloc protesters said they were mainly present to defend local organizers from white supremacist aggression. "They're here in our defense," one Black Lives Matter organizer announced by megaphone, as clusters of black bloc linked arms on intersections and stuck close to the group for the duration of Kessler's rally.. . Dressed in black from head to toe so as to conceal their identity, they began to show up in larger numbers once Kessler had arrived at his rally point.  Despite the midsummer heat, many black bloc protesters wore masks, motorcycle helmets and dense body armor. Others carried black umbrellas, which they often used to block the media from photographing them.. . Though were no incidents of violence for the duration of Kessler's rally, tensions briefly rose when a group of anti-fascist protesters attempted to prevent Kessler's group from leaving by launching fireworks and throwing eggs over a line of U.S. Park Police and Secret Service at 17th and G Streets. In a flare-up of tension, police charged into a makeshift barrier made of shopping carts and cardboard, running into protesters and media.. . There were no injuries or arrests, and much of the crowd dispersed soon after learning that Kessler's rally had been escorted out of the park in a police van.. . Filmed by Alejandro Alvarez. .

The driver called him, claiming to be pulled over, then never showed or called back, leaving Kessler and his comrades briefly stranded.. . After the rally was all over, he called back claiming to be detained all day.. . Tonight, after "Unite the Right," News2Share's Ford Fischer had exclusive access to film as the supposed bus driver called Kessler back. Claiming to have been pulled over by the police and detained for eight hours and interrogated by an unknown law enforcement agency, it became clear that the supposed bus driver was a trick to stifle "Unite the Right's" plans.. .

Carrying a sign that read “Expel the Jews,” Little was approached by several activists, including one Jewish woman.. . Little told the women that “Jews rape children” and then accused her of “attempted assault and battery” when she stood in his path, physically blocking him.. . When confronted about being a national socialist, Little clarified that he now considers himself a “Nationally social democratic American patriot,” who opposes Donald Trump because he “has got Jews married to his family” and supports Israel.. . Little posted last month on “Gab” that he “will see the destruction of at least one US holocaust memorial in the next 12 months, or I will take a sledge hammer to one myself.”. . When confronted on the post, Little asked News2Share, “You got one that I can destroy made of sugar cubes or something?”. . The posts were deleted from Gab earlier today after the website’s host threatened to delete the entire website.. . While on the extreme fringes of the “alt-right,” Little said that he will not be attending Sunday’s “Unite the right 2” rally at the White House.. . When pressed on the matter he added, “No, no. I’m a Democrat candidate. I’m opposed to Trump’s support of the genocide of the religious and ethnic minorities of Palestine.”. . “Well how about the Syrians when the Jews are committing a genocide against them?” he asked before walking away.. .

Prior to the announcement, Mayor Bowser hosted a roundtable discussion with community and faith leaders about the upcoming events..  . “As the nation’s capital, we host millions of visitors each year. Fortunately, very, very few share the views that will be expressed in Lafayette Park on Sunday. Washington, DC is a city of love, inclusion, and diversity, and – like millions of Americans across the nation – we know that the people who are coming here to profess hate and sow division are wrong,” said Mayor Bowser. “This weekend, and every day going forward, we will ensure that the world knows that no matter how much attention these people demand, that they will never represent the values of our city or our nation.”.  . According to a press release: "The level two activation of the District’s EOC allows local, state, and federal agencies to work together to coordinate the necessary supports for all critical incident responses. Ahead of this weekend’s events, residents and visitors are being encouraged to sign up for AlertDC at alertdc.dc.gov to receive important and emergency updates from DC Government.". . “Several District agencies, regional partners, and federal agencies are staffing the District’s EOC to support the law enforcement response,” said DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency Director Dr. Christopher Rodriguez. “Residents and visitors should sign up for AlertDC and be prepared if they see something, to say something to law enforcement.”.  . The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is coordinating with U.S. Park Police (USPP) and other District and Federal partners to deploy appropriate resources and personnel for the event..  . “The Metropolitan Police Department facilitates safe demonstrations on a daily basis,” says Chief of Police Peter Newsham. “Our intentions are to continue to value the first amendment rights of everyone in the District of Columbia without compromising the safety of participants or bystanders.”.  . MPD says will enforce the following road closures on Sunday, August 12, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.:.  . ·         15th Street, NW, from Constitution Avenue to K Street, NW. ·         17th Street, NW, from Constitution Avenue to K Street, NW. ·         18th Street, NW, from E Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. ·         19th Street, NW, from E Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. ·         20th Street, NW, from E Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. ·         21st Street, NW, from E Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. ·         22nd Street, NW, from E Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. ·         23rd Street, NW, from Virginia Avenue to Washington Circle, NW. ·         H Street, NW from 17th Street to 15th Street, NW. ·         I Street, NW from 17th Street to 15th Street, NW. ·         K Street, NW from 17th Street to 15th Street, NW. ·         Connecticut Avenue, NW, from H Street to I Street, NW. ·         Vermont Avenue, NW, from H Street to I Street, NW. ·         G Street, NW, from 17th Street to 23rd Street, NW. ·         F Street, NW, from 17th Street to 23rd Street, NW. ·         E Street, NW from 17th Street to 23rd Street, NW.  .

Inside a outwardly unremarkable row house in D.C.’s Shaw neighborhood, several dozen activists with the Washington-based Answer Coalition presided over a long wooden table, in a makeshift production line churning out hundreds of picket signs. They declared, in no uncertain terms: “Shut down white supremacy.”. . “We’re going to demonstrate just how tiny and isolated the fascists are,” Walter Smolarek, an Answer Coalition activist, told News2Share. “We think that the most effective way to fight fascism is to bring out the masses of people, to bring out the majority of people who reject racism, and reject the hatred of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.”. . The Answer Coalition is one of several progressive, left-wing social movements seeking to confront Kessler’s rally. Rooted in anti-war activism, Answer — an acronym for “Act Now to Stop War and End Racism” — rose to prominence in the wake of the September 11 attacks and rallied thousands across the country against the Iraq War.. . On Wednesday, the National Park Service approved the group’s permit to set up a sound stage in the northeastern corner of Lafayette Square, making Answer one of the first organizations with an approved permit to demonstrate on Sunday. Organizers said they expected up to 400 people to pack into their permit area beginning at 1 p.m..  . “What we plan on having is a disciplined demonstration, one that people can come to and feel that they’re secure,” Smolarek said. Though he described a sense of solidarity with anti-fascist organizers who might opt for more direct confrontation, Smolarek stressed that Answer sought to remain peaceful and make a decisive statement against far-right through sheer numbers alone.. . Smolarek also pushed back against media narratives portraying anti-fascist protesters as miscreants and violent deviants.. . “We think that the demonization of anti-racist and anti-fascist protest is part of a move to actually give the Klansmen and Nazis room to breathe,” Smolarek said. “They’re created this whole media phenomenon, this scare tactic that if you try to rally in the streets for progressive and left-wing values, it’s just going to be a riot because these scary antifa people will be there.”. . Yasmina Mrabet, Answer Coalition’s permit holder, told News2Share that she sees Sunday’s far-right presence as only the latest expression in a long-running, deeply rooted racist backbone in American society. In their reasoning, Mrabet and Smolarek both hearkened back to the Answer Coalition’s anti-imperialist roots in linking American foreign policy and ideology with racism, xenophobia, and white supremacy.. . “In my mind, white supremacy is the agenda of capitalism, and is the agenda of capitalist America, because capitalism relies on social divisions to maintain itself,” Mrabet said. “We believe that ignoring an ultraright movement like this would embolden them and make them grow bigger and stronger, and feel like they actually have a platform to freely spread their message — we can’t let that happen.”. .

Left-wing groups in Washington sought to confront the president for what they deemed an act of treason following Trump's rebuff of the American intelligence community in favor of Putin's word. After mobilizing demonstrators through social media to shout down Trump's return from Helsinki on Monday night, former Hillary Clinton advisor Philippe Reines joined with Stormy Daniels lawyer and outspoken Trump opponent Michael Avenatti to spearhead a second night of events in Lafayette Square outside the White House.. . “Yesterday was the day Trump all but acknowledged that Putin is the President of the United States," said Avenatti, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd reminiscent of a celebrity. "Why do you keep choosing one of our biggest foreign foes instead of us?. . Avenatti compared Russian meddling to an attack on American self-determination, invoking "invasion" and "strategic surgical strike" to describe an act of aggression he saw as "no different than if they had placed 100,000 troops on our border." Introducing Avenatti, lead organizer Reines referred to Trump as a "squatter," repeating his closing message from the previous night deeming the president to be illegitimate and the office to be, in effect, vacant.. . As with the previous night, most of Tuesday's chanting revolved around accusations of treason, corruption, and collusion levied toward the embattled president. "Who's the puppet, you're the puppet," began protesters, who at several points throughout the event chanted "traitor" and "impeach" toward the north-facing side of the White House. Cardboard signs featured Trump's face on farcical cartoon characters, and others featured the president behind bars or wearing a prison uniform. For about an hour and a half, protesters huddled around a podium and heard from several speakers just short of the north fence.. . Despite a name evoking Occupy Wall Street, "Occupy Lafayette Square" involved little in the way of occupying, as far as anything along the lines of New York City's Zuccotti Park in 2011. Though a third night of protests were planned Wednesday evening, no protesters had plans to pitch tents and sit-in throughout the night on Tuesday. A smaller group of demonstrators remained after the organizers had left, at one point kneeling and reciting the preamble to the Declaration of Independence before gradually dispersing.. .

A dissenting pro-Trump counter-protest branding itself as a "MAGA Unity Rally" took place across the street. . . "Free Speech Rally to your left, PC (politically correct) rally to your right," read one "Speak English Please" protester's sign standing between the two groups.. . "This is a beautiful country and why not have a national language? We're not saying it's the only language to speak. We're saying it should be the priority to learn English in America!" Val told News2Share.. . Protesters wearing "Make America Great Again" caps yelled at Val as he approached their event. "You're a filthy liar! We're here to support President Trump!" one yelled at him.. . "You're yelling at me in English," Val replied.. . The event wasn't without non-Trump-supporting counter-protesters as well. As the groups chanted, one woman walked by with a sign reading "Caging children? Sig Heil President Pussy.". . "Build that wall! Build that wall!" the Unity Rally chanted.. . "God gives us Jesus, and now God gives us Donald J Trump. That's two for two. Who's next? Maybe Barron Trump might be the third messiah," said one "Speak English Please" participant to passerby's. . . "I'm a Nazi, and I order you to the concentration camps," the same participant said to someone who called him a "Nazi" in passing. "Oh, you're not doing it? I must not be a Nazi then, jackass.". . After rallying for about two hours outside Trump Tower, "Speak English Please" marched to the Trump International Hotel, a bit less than a mile away. As they arrived, a number of more heated arguments began.. . "This is the first nigga they're gonna put in the oven," said one angry New Yorker, pointing at a "Speak English Please" participant with a "Jews for Trump" sign.. . "Your hats are like swastikas. Your hats are like KKK," another said, referring to the "Make America Great Again" caps.. . Video by Ford Fischer. .

Kokesh and his group say that the Libertarian Party is the only political party in America that addresses their concerns by allowing marijuana and other drugs as treatments, and calling for a "platform of peace.". . Kokesh presented a folded American flag signed by the activists to Nicholas Sarwark, the Libertarian Party Chair.. . "The Libertarian Party is the only national political party committed to the solutions that will really get to the root causes of veteran suicide in this country," Sarwark told the crowd. "Namely, increased opiate addiction, not sending our men and women oversees to die in other countries' civil wars, and generally promoting a policy of peace.". . “More than 20 veterans commit suicide every day. Our government and much of the media have been silent about this tragedy,” Marcus Pulis, Kokesh’s Press Secretary, in a press release. “It is the Kokesh Campaign’s goal to give voice to the voiceless, who are gone but not forgotten. It is time to end the drug war and give the VA to the veterans.”. . Produced by Ford Fischer. . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

Immigrant-led group Movimiento Cosecha rallied outside the main offices of Immigrations of Customs Enforcement in southwest DC with the intent of shutting down the building. Over the course of two hours, the group moved through a series of direct actions aimed at preventing access to the office complex, including blocking off driveways and forming a human chain across 12th Street.. . Unlike other recent actions calling for immigration agencies to be defunded or legally limited, Cosecha called for the abolition of ICE in its entirety - a narrative gaining traction lately within the left. “Fuck your borders, fuck your walls, we will make your system fall,” chanted protesters on Wednesday morning, to which a speaker added: “Dismantle ICE, because they are the American Gestapo.”. . After a rally in the driveway abuzz with the clanging of pots and pans, about half the group took to an elevated walkway around the building, where they peered through windows shouting “quit your jobs” at the workers within. Many of the ground floor cubicles they passed were empty, and the group’s leader announced that the agency had advised employees to avoid the building in anticipation of the protest. News2Share has not independently verified this claim.. . Although some protesters were prepared to face arrest for the cause, police largely kept their distance and watched.. . For about two weeks now, pro-immigration groups have been energized by stories of child detention at government facilities along the border with Mexico. Several actions are planned in the nation’s capital this week demanding a complete end to immigrant family detention, ahead of a larger rally on Saturday outside the White House.. .

Pro-gun activists face off with counter-demo</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2018</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"Black guns matter! Black guns matter!" chanted a coalition of pro-gun activists outside the Supreme Court Tuesday afternoon.. . Pro-gun activists including leaders of the Second Amendment Institute and Gun Owners of America gathered to celebrate District v Heller, a supreme Court decision that held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia or a government agency.. . The decision effectively forced Washington DC to issue permits to carry concealed firearms to private citizens. Before Heller, carrying firearms was effectively banned.. . "On page after page, the court demolished the left's legal position and documented just how wrong their position was," said Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.. . Congressman Thomas Massie kicked off the rally, asserting that politicians still fight against the right to bear arms every year, citing in particular laws that would raise the age to buy a gun to 21.. . "I'm worried about unconstitutional legislation that has been proposed to raise the legal age to buy a gun from 18 to 21,"  he explained. "Folks, you're an adult. If you're 18, you can die for our country, you can vote, you should be able to defend yourself.". . Hundreds of counter-demonstrators confronted the activists, many of them having participated in a nearby rally against the Supreme Court's decision upholding a Trump Administration Travel Ban.. . "DC laws for DC people!" one demonstrator with left-leaning activist group CODEPINK chanted repeatedly, supporting the idea that the nation's capitol should be able to pass its own, stricter gun laws.. . "We know we have haters, but haters are going to motivate us to do great things," said Diante Johnson, President of Black Conservative Federation. "Hates are gonna motivate us to say that you cannot take our guns away!". . As counter-protesters chanted "No ban, no wall," the gun rights supporters retorted "Black guns matter!" in a chant led by Maj Toure (who wore a shirt that read "Make the good great again"), the founder of an organization also called "Black Guns Matter.". . "Whether you're gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects us all!" added Gregory T. Angelo, president of Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBT conservative group. "No amendment protects us more than the second amendment!". . Dick Heller, the plaintiff in the original case, closed out the event, highlighting the hundreds of cases siting DC v Heller in the past decade. "These are proof that the struggle of evil and tyranny will rage on against liberty as long as some parties show that they hate our country as much as we love our country, love our lives, and love to protect our family with our second amendment freedoms.". . Tyler Yaguirre, who organized the rally, called it "very patriotic, very American.". . Of the counter-protesters, he has some harsher words. "They're honestly just petulant children, little brats. If they actually cared about healing the nation, they'd wanna work together.". . Dick Heller, the plaintiff in the original case, told News2Share that the counter-protesters are "confused" and he respects their first amendment right to speak just has much as his second amendment right  to carry a gun.. .

The action was organized by LA RED  (Liberation, Action, Respect, Equity, Dignity). Other groups involved included Faith in Action, DMV Sanctuary Congregation Network, Franciscan Action Network, National Domestic workers Alliance, Moms Rising, and We Belong Together.. . Dozens of children sat next to dog cages and wore Mylar survival blankets to mimic the conditions faced by detained immigrant children.. . LA Red director Richard Morales told News2Share that he organized the event because, "We are outraged by the Trump administration's policy of zero tolerance, which is leading to the family separation. It is also leading to mass incarceration and the long term detention of immigrant families.". . "We are here today to ask congress to pressure the administration to do everything in their power to make sure families are not only together, but free.". . "I think the worst thing you can do to a child, as an immigrant, is to separate them from their families," added Lorenzo Morales, Richard's ten-year-old son.. . Richard Morales also told News2Share that Trump's executive order to keep families together doesn't go far enough. "It's not sufficient. What he needs to do is end the zero-tolerance policy," he said. He explained that if convicted of entering the country illegally, a migrant family would still be separated.. . Rev. Dr. Robert M. Hardies of All Souls Church Unitarian explained that he found comments by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the subject to be a travesty.. . "It's really just so untruthful to sort of turn to the bible to justify this cruel treatment of children. It couldn't be further from Jesus's message," he told News2Share.. . The action lasted about 20 minutes total before police shut it down. The group backed down and retreated outside after being given three warnings by Capitol Police. The activists also said they planned to deliver letters to members of congress later in the day.. . Faith In Action plans to hold similar demonstrations this weekend at the U.S.-Mexico border.. .

News2Share has extensively covered a number of activist events in the wake of the Parkland shooting focusing on further gun control to prevent school violence. Nexus CEO Mike Donovan told News2Share that Cruz feels differently about the solution. . . "What he told me was 'gun control is not gonna solve the problem,'" Donovan explained. "At least not always, and not fully. There are kids still killing themselves, every day. There are kids still turning to drugs and alcohol every day.". . "It may not be a mass shooting, but there are kids killing themselves everywhere. In every community. And gun control isn't going to change that.". .

The activists dropped to to the ground and played dead for 12 minutes. The duration of 700 seconds was meant symbolize the approximate number of lives lost due to mass shootings since the Pulse Nightclub Massacre.. . This figure relies on a definition of mass shooting as a single incident with four or more injured or dead.. . About a dozen counter demonstrators with "Patriot Picket" showed up to silently protest in favor of gun rights. Holding American and Gadsden Flags, the group conversed and debated with some participants. Dick Heller, plaintiff in the Supreme Court District v Heller, attended. In that case, the majority ruling held that "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.". . "I’m gathering today with fellow patriots to defend our constitutional rights and take a stand for the second amendment," explained Tyler Yzaguirre, organizer of the counter demonstration and President of the Second Amendment Institute. "Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. Well, that generation is here.". . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

The group, normally skeptical of Trump on a variety of issues, said that "we applaud President Trump. Peace is what we want.". . "I'm not a Trump supporter by any means. I think this is a move in the right direction, and I think we need to pray for him and support him in this effort," said activist Rocky Twyman. "If it fails, it could be catastrophic.". . "We don't need threats. We certainly don't need war," said Brienne Kordis, CODEPINK DC Director. "So this was a chance to mark this monumental moment where leaders are meeting to talk, to hopefully put differences aside.". . "I think that Mr. Trump, although he has been unpredictable on a number of other issue areas, sees the wisdom of ending the Korean War and allowing the Korean people to come together again," said Aiyoung Choi, a member of the group Women Cross DMZ. "There's a chance Mr. Trump might surprise us and be consistent on this point.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

A state department representative came outside and listened to the activists, who handed him a two-page letter detailing their positions. The activists feel that Cavusoglu will "ask for permission to commit a genocide in Manbij like they did in Afrin.". . "The U.S. know what Turkish fascism is. Today, there are U.S. citizens imprisoned in Turkey, and the fascist thugs of the Turkish security forces have even attacked people who protest and dissent here in Washington. The violence the U.S. has been complicit in in Turkey, where the consequences can be ignored, have now struck U.S. citizens. We expect U.S. leaders to understand this, and act accordingly," says the letter. "The system of Democratic Federation of Northern Syria is the only hope for democracy and peace in the Middle East.

"This Rally is to bring awareness about a local company named Libre Nexus and what they have brought into my community and other communities around the country. This company provides GPS tracking devices to those in the USA illegally," the group's Facebook event said. "By doing, this the company is putting unsuspecting folks at risk in our peaceful community for a large profit.". . About a dozen militiamen arrived at the Government Center for the event. As the event was set to begin, a representative of Nexus arrived on location and officially served a defamation lawsuit to Penny Rutter, one of the event's organizers.. . Nexus CEO Michael Donovan had previously condemned the event as racist. "Nexus will stand against white supremacist and war mongering organizations that seek to destabilize our country and promote hate and intimidation against immigrants and minorities," he told Newsleader last month.. . "He's real keen on trying to scare people," said Larry Lewis, who was also named in the lawsuit. "I'm open to talk to him at any time. It kinda makes me feel like he has something to hide if he's trying to shut us up right here.". . Ace Baker, founder of the "American Warrior Revolution" said that he would sue Nexus for being "racist to legal immigrants." . . "Those programs are only offered to illegals. They're not offered to those that are willing to do it the right way.". . Before the rally officially got underway, Donovan called Lewis and offered for his group to meet to talk out their issues. Although only a fraction of the group participated, the event was migrated into a dialogue with Lewis at the Nexus campus. The only pre-condition that was set for the meeting: no guns. . . "Penny Rutter White Supremacist" and "Larry Lewis White Supremacist" read two banners with images of their respective faces on the company's campus. The signs were taken down as the activists arrived, and given to them as a gesture of good faith.. . Employees, including security, for Nexus met with the activists in a company board room. Zachary Cruz, the brother of Parkland school shooter Nicholas Cruz, sat in on the meeting. Zachary is out on a $500,000 bond secured by Nexus after being accused of trespassing on the Marjory Stoneman Douglass High school weeks after the shooting. . . "I saw you saying you wanted to talk Larry, and when I saw that, I said 'well then why don't we do that?' That's why you're here," Donovan explained to the activist leaders. "The lawsuit that was served on you both was for saying things that were purporting to be facts, that were not fact, that were not correct. In some cases they inferred illegal activities, and under the law that's called defamation per say. You can't do that.".  . "If you write me a letter that says that the things that you said which are specifically laid out in the lawsuit are fact, are things that you retract, then I will the lawsuit and there won't be any need for litigation.". . "The important thing is to have open dialogue, communication so you can learn from the other people," said Gary Sigler, commander of the Maryland III% Peoples Militia.. . "Government abuse isn't just something that happens to immigrants, it's also something that happens to immigrants," Donovan pointed out. Emphasizing the possibility of common ground, he pointed out that he shares skepticism of state entities such as the FBI infiltrating militia organizations. . . While the groups parted ways with some ongoing disagreement, the nearly 90-minute meeting proved productive. . . "This is wear it's at. I appreciate you inviting us over," concluded Baker.. . It is unclear whether Rutter and Lewis will respond to the lawsuit with a retraction or go to court.. .

For the latest in a multi-week campaign protesting the "nation's distorted morality" through civil disobedience, the Poor People's Campaign led hundreds to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office demanding an end to violence at home and abroad. Protesters filed down the hall in silence, holding signs like "fight poverty, not the poor" and "the war economy is immoral," reflecting the group's anti-war stance.. . After delivering an American flag folded by veterans to the desk clerk in McConnell's office, activists collected white flowers in the doorway as Capitol Police began arrests. About two dozen protesters were led out of the building in the moments that followed, chanting "we remember" in memory of lives lost to acts of violence around the world.. . The Poor People's Campaign is holding weekly rallies on Capitol grounds as part of its "40 days of moral fusion." each focusing on a specific issue stemming from wealth inequality, racism, and climate change. Similar events are planned on healthcare and education, before a concluding rally set for June 23.. .

The event commemorated the 1948 Palestinian exodus, also known as the Nakba, where 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Palestine war. The activists condemned Israel's current treatment of Palestinians, particularly in light of President Trump's recent decision to move the American-Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. . . On one side of the group, dozens of posters of Ahed Tamimi were picketed into the ground. Tamimi is a Palestinian teenager whose angry altercation with an Israeli soldier outside her West Bank home left her with an 8 month prison sentence. Tamimi slapped an Israeli soldier after her cousin was shot with a rubber-coated steel bullet.. . "70 years of Israeli occupation on Palestinian land," was the motivation for the protest, said Kareem El-Hosseiny. "We're protesting the indiscriminate actions of the Israeli government against the Palestinian People in Gaza and saying this cannot stand." . . According to the event's Facebook page: "Performers and storytellers include: Oud and vocals by Fuad Foty, Poetry by Samar Najia, Poetry by Zeina Azzam, Nakba education by Philip Farah, Storytelling by Nora Burgan, Storytelling by Jamal Najjab.". . The event's cosponsors were listed as: "Ad Hoc Committee for the Nakba, Washington Interfaith Alliance for Middle East Peace (WIAMEP), US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), Palestinian Christian Alliance for Peace - PCAP (PCAP), American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), Jewish Voice for Peace - DC Metro, US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, and American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).". .

Amid backlash from Palestinian protesters, human rights organizations, and international institutions, a group of young, anti-occupation American Jews voiced their opposition to the new embassy by locking down one of the Washington’s busiest intersections.. . “I’m sick and tired of Donald Trump and other politicians using perceived American Jewish support for the occupation for policy that supports this endless occupation,” said Noah Schuettge, a member of IfNotNow, a youth-led group of Jewish activists opposed to Israeli policy on Palestine. “This is the tip of the iceberg, and there are many of us.”. . IfNotNow led about one hundred people to the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 12th Street, which they held for over an hour while sharing stories about use of lethal force by Israeli soldiers against protesters. They carried cardboard columns, forming what they called an “Embassy of Freedom” in the middle of the street as rebuttal to the new embassy in Jerusalem.. . While members of the Trump family joined diplomats for an opening ceremony in Jerusalem, the death toll mounted along the Gaza border fence in a bloodbath that could soon prove to be the worst the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen in years. The number of fatalities stands at 52 with over 2,400 injured as of publication. In the aftermath, independent journalist Sharif Kouddous spoke with a Palestinian doctor who remarked he had “never seen a day like this” in 17 years working at a Gaza hospital.. . “What’s newsworthy is that we could do all of this freely, and that Palestinians could not,” said Stephen Lurie, an IfNotNow member, noting that they held a Washington intersection in rush hour traffic without facing arrest while Palestinians were killed and injured overseas. “What’s newsworthy is that we could exercise our rights and our privilege like we ought to, but Palestinians could not.”. . Israel has defended its response as being necessary to protect its border communities, although world leaders and activists have criticized their use of live fire as disproportionate to protesters using slingshots and burning tires. A tweet from the Israeli Defense Forces after Monday’s violence claimed its soldiers were acting “in accordance with standard operating procedures,” in order to “protect Israeli sovereignty and Israeli citizens.”. . IfNotNow’s contingent of young American Jews weren’t in agreement.. . “I feel threatened by the Israeli government inflaming anti-Semitism by doing clearly immoral things,” said Jill Raney, an IfNotNow activist who led much of the chanting and singing on Monday. “Palestinians are not a threat to me, I don’t feel any reason to put up walls with huge machine guns between me and my neighbors.”. . More protests are planned in Palestine on Tuesday, the annual commemoration of mass Palestinian displacement following the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. May 15 is remembered as “Nakba Day” among Arabs, meaning “Day of the Catastrophe.”. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

On January 20, 2017, 230 people were arrested during demonstrations against Donald Trump's inauguration.. . Of these initial arrestees, 215 were charged under the Federal Riot Statute. The prosecution argues that every protester should be guilty for all property damage that took place during the demonstration, whether the individuals charged committed the crimes personally or not. . . "We recognize this trial as what it is. It's an attempt to literally criminalize dissent," said Chip Gibbons, a reporter at Defending Rights & Dissent. "The prosecution in making their case has tried to turn journalism and protesting into elements of a criminal offense.". . "We are definitely hopeful about the show of support that's been demonstrated over and over again throughout this entire space by the DC community," added Sam Menefee-Libey of DC Legal Posse. . . One trial group was acquitted of all charges on November 15, 2017, and the Attorney's Office dismissed cases without prejudice against an additional 129 defendants on January 18, 2018 — but didn’t drop their charges, meaning they still face nearly 6 years of uncertainty since the prosecution can reinstate the charges during that time.. . A remaining 59 people are being prosecuted with multiple felonies and face 60 years in prison.. . "Protesting is not a crime, L12 should do no crime," chanted Dylan Petrohilos. (L12 is a reference to the intersection of L Street and 12th Street in Washington, where the majority of the arrests took place).. . "We've been continually seeing people getting charged with felony offenses for standing up and fighting back," Manning said of activists during the Trump era. "This is not about the J20 defendants so much as it is about everyone's ability and right to be able to fight back.". . "I'm not a politician.

"This event will have speakers from around the country who have left Homosexuality/Transgender lives to follow Jesus Christ!" read the event's Facebook description, which used #oncegay as a hashtag.. . "I believe some of you here today are still battling [LGBT] thoughts and temptations. God wants to deliver you from every yoke of bondage," said Anite Angelo, "He wants you to take every thought captive and lay aside every weight in the sin that so easily does entangle you.". . Angelo says that "for 30+ years, I lived and practiced a gay lifestyle." She explained that she believes God led her from both her sexuality and her affliction as an alcoholic. . . Conservative blogger Elizabeth Johnston, commonly known as  "The Activist Mommy," explains she considers herself an ally, "to one of the most marginalized and censored groups in our culture, and that is the ex-homosexual.". . "I am pro-choice," she added. "I believe those who choose to engage in homosexual sin also have the right not to engage in homosexuality, and they have the choice to seek therapy for their unnatural and unwanted desires.". . "I am tolerant. I want homosexuals to have the freedom to speak their mind and beliefs. Do we not? And I believe those who believe who believe homosexuality is a sin against God also have the right under God and under our first amendment to speak our beliefs," she concluded. "That is tolerance.". . "I just am trying to use their own terminology to show how hypocritical they are on the left, basically," Johnston later told News2Share.. . Ronald McCray, who says he has "been delivered from a life of homosexuality for going nine years," spoke to News2Share alongside his wife, who also has been in same-sex relationships. He said that the activists went to DC to "share our testimonies of freedom, not just from sexual sin, but from the rule and dominion of sin - period - that led me into promiscuity.". . His wife, Fetima McCray, says that she still experiences temptations of sexuality with women, but doesn't act on them. She says God "is giving us the power to overcome the desires of the flesh.". . The activists marched from the National Mall to the White House, drawing an audience with chants like "Freedom in Christ, it's so nice.". . Coincidentally, President Donald Trump arrived in his Marine One helicopter at The White House during the march. Activists waved at the president as they marched, and had to change routes due to a secret service shut down of the area on Trump's arrival.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

"I am tolerant. I want homosexuals to have the freedom to speak their mind and beliefs. Do we not? And I believe those who believe who believe homosexuality is a sin against God also have the right under God and under our first amendment to speak our beliefs," she concluded. "That is tolerance.". . "I just am trying to use their own terminology to show how hypocritical they are on the left, basically," Johnston later told News2Share.. . Clip Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

He was 28 years old.. . News2Share's last sit-down interview with Traywick took place February 2nd. Although included as part of a livestream profiling a bio-hacking lab, the raw interview was previously unreleased.. . Biohacking is a form of science research that hopes to push medical technology without invoking academic, state, or big corporate actors. It tends to heavily emphasize independence and experimentation. Transhumanism is a movement that seeks to evolve the human species beyond its natural limits, primarily through technology.. . "Floating" is meditation method where an individual places themselves into a sound-proof pod filled with salt water at body temperature, which gives the sensation of floating in empty space. The practice is meant to promote a state of deep meditation.. . "He was found face down," Roberts explained. Other details were not immediately available.. . News2Share first covered Traywick's work in October, when he provided a DIY HIV gene-editing substance to Tristan Roberts, who self-injected it.. . “Essentially one percent, and really even less than one percent, of persons currently with HIV, for reasons that are aren’t really clearly known, these persons developed a genetic immunity once they contracted the HIV,” explained Traywick. His mission, he said, is to share the one percent’s immunity “with the 99%.”. . Results in that experiment are currently inconclusive.. . The following February, Traywick publicly injected himself with a substance he co-created as a gene-editing cure and immunization against herpes.. . “The procedure itself is a simple one,” Traywick told News2Share. “If my herpes goes away, and the vaccine remains detectable in the blood upon subsequent lab analysis, we know it works as a cure.”. . . The Food and Drug Administration responded with a thinly-veiled swipe that, while avoiding specific mention of Traywick’s experiment, expressed concern about the safety of self-administered gene therapies and advised consumers to refrain from undergoing treatments not approved or studied “under appropriate regulatory oversight.”. . Production specialist Machiavelli Davis regarded the absence of a corporate or academic hierarchy as a strength, not a weakness. “Working with a tight knit team of passionate friends is also a far better experience than just being brought together because of a corporate job,” Davis said, noting that each of the team’s members had prior experience with self-experimentation.. . “It’s disruptive toward anybody who economically benefits from people being dependant on you having to buy your way into health,” Traywick said of his hopes to dive into curing, rather than treating, diseases.. . He believed that insurance providers and government entities have set up incentives, “to keep the patient sick, but not sick enough that they’ll die, but also not healthy enough that they’re really living.”. . “There is no incentive structure set up for cures,” he pointed out. “If you cure a disease, the government will not pay a company for the number of healthy years of life that have been given to that person.”. . “New incentive structures are coming into place, and those look pretty interesting, but at the same time, we’re not waiting around for that.”. .

The event was entirely peaceful and participants were not openly armed. The consensus among the speakers and attendees is that using the political process is essential to preserving gun rights, but that the second amendment itself provides a final line of defense.. .

One is with the blood of patriots and tyrants. But while it's parched, why not water it with the tears of our foes?"

As a private company, shouldn't Youtube have free speech rights of its own?. . Jones responds with a lengthy answer emphasizing the "You" in "Youtube" and claiming that Google has grown the service to be so big that it could be subject to anti-trust laws. . . Jones wouldn't answer a follow-up on whether he'd move to any other platform if Youtube kicked him off the site, instead portraying Youtube as a platform that would interrupt a question like that with an ad from the SPLC.. .

In their most recent action opposing Israel’s treatment of Palestine, women’s anti-war group CODEPINK led about two dozen people near the White House’s north fence chanting “free Palestine” and “border walls have got to go.” One protester likened the latest deadly incident in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to an ongoing apartheid.. . According to Palestinian health officials, eighteen people are dead and hundreds injured after Israeli soldiers used live rounds on protesters rallying near the border on Land Day, an annual event commemorating a popular strike in response to Israel’s seizure of land in 1976. . . The Israeli government justified its use of force as a countermeasure against rioters and “invaders,” though activists pointed out a disproportionate amount of damage dealt to the Palestinian side. The United States, for its part, blocked a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an independent probe into Israel’s actions. The State Department has also been criticized for its response.. . “Israel and a majority of the media framed the massacre as two-sided, a consequence of clashes and the fault of Hamas,” read a statement released to the press by CODEPINK, which noted that none of the protesters appeared to be armed. “Some of the those killed were shot in the back as they tried to run away.”. . Video originally broadcast by Palestinian media appears to show protesters being shot in the back while fleeing the area. Other footage shows Israeli-controlled drones dropping canisters of tear gas on protesters, one of the first documented uses of the new technology. Both these factors have galvanized pro-Palestine groups into action across the world, with solidarity rallies in Tel Aviv, Ireland, and San Francisco.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The group says the second amendment is non-negotiable, and advocates that armed security is a better measure for protecting students from gun violence in schools. . . "We're representing the second amendment's most important function, and that's to protect the first amendment being exercised by the masses of people today," Dick Heller told News2Share while participating in the Patriot Picket.. . Heller was the plaintiff in the landmark gun rights Supreme Court case Heller v. District of Columbia, which struck down provisions of DC's Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 as unconstitutional. The case resulted in Washington DC having to issue concealed carry permits for handguns in the district.. . "We simply want the folks who are gathered here to remember that our republic can't operate without civil rights," Patriot Picket Founder Jeff Hulbert. "The second amendment does serve a purpose.". . Hulbert said he came prepared in the event that protesters attacked his group. "We brought helmets just in case," he said.. . About a dozen militia members clad in tactical gear (absent firearms) associated with the III% movement attended the rally. . . Danny Bollinger, a Maryland III%er, told News2Share "I'm here to support our second amendment.". . "Gun control doesn't stop crazy people. If you wanna kill someone enough, you'll stab somebody," he added.. . Interactions with March for our Lives participants had mixed results. Some shook hands, agreeing to disagree. Others chanted "Shame!" repeatedly over the demonstration.. . "Jesus would not be holding those signs, you all should be ashamed of yourself," exclaimed an anti-gun protester wearing a shirt displaying the Pulse Nightclub logo.. .

Although it only had a handful of attendees, the activists brought to light many of the questions that some say society will need to answer urgently decades from now. . . Among them: Do we need a new bill of rights specifically for "cyborgs?". . Cyborgs are individuals who choose to alter their body by combining it with technology.. . "As the electronic frontier moves into our bodies, it is important that we cyber-libertarians march as allies alongside the cyborgs among us and the cyborgs we will all someday become," said the activists. "What do we want? Cyborg rights! When do we want them? Now!". . The event was followed by the EFF-Austin annual cyberpunk party, where people flaunted their electronic modifications and costumes.. . Below is the current "Cyborg Bill of Rights" composed by Rich MacKinnon, former board member of the ACLU of Texas. What do you think? Comment your ideas.. . THE CYBORG BILL OF RIGHTS:. .

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee launched its yearly policy conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, often attended by high-ranking public officials including sitting senators and former presidents.. . Donald Trump’s decision to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, coupled with detentions of activists including 17-year old Ahed Tamimi, contributed to what was already widespread discontent and anger in the Palestinian community over the status quo.. . Miko Peled, an author who served in the Israeli Defense Forces as part of the country’s mandatory conscription program, decried the past year in Arab-Israeli relations as one marred by “violence, racism, and lies.”. . “I’m here just like everybody else to say ‘free Palestine,’ to stand with Palestine,” Peled said, “to end of the legitimacy of the racist regime in Palestine, which is the state of Israel.”. . For the last several years, prominent left-wing activist groups including CODEPINK and the ANSWER Coalition, who style themselves as “anti-apartheid” and “anti-occupation,” have marched on the convention as Israeli-Palestinian relations continue to deteriorate.. . Several hundred protesters gathered outside the White House waving Palestinian flags and posters of imprisoned activists. Secret Service unsuccessfully tried to clear protesters from the area despite a valid permit, citing unspecified security concerns. The group then marched down New York Avenue without incident.. . Protesters faced a police presence outside the main entrance to AIPAC’s conference, sealed off to the public by barriers. CODEPINK co-founder Medea Benjamin joined others to hoist a banner proclaiming “free Palestine” to conference-goers, who at times gathered inside the entrance to snap photos on their phones.. . Meriem Abou-Ghazaleh, a young Syrian-Palestinian activist who protested the siege of Aleppo last year, led the crowd in chants supporting the "boycott, divestment, and sanctions" movement, an emerging international effort to boycott Israel over its Palestine policy.. . “America and Israel are butt buddies, they’re puppets,” she later told News2share, “America is a puppet of Israel - they know that without Israel, they are nothing.”. . CODEPINK and 19 other organizations were recently banned from entering Israel over their support for BDS. AIPAC's agenda this year involves supporting federal legislation that would criminalize involvement in the boycott, an act the ACLU warns would violate free speech.. . Also present were members of Neturei Karta, a fringe group of ultra-orthodox Jews who support dismantling the Israeli state and who often march alongside like-minded Palestinian protesters in Washington. "Judaism is a subservience to God, it is a religion, and Zionism is a transformation to nationalism," said Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a Neturei Karta rabbi, "it’s forbidden for us to steal or occupy, they have the audacity to hijack our identity.”. . Despite anger and frustration, the mood generally trended less tense than previous years. Whereas at least a dozen members of anti-occupation group IfNotNow faced arrest in an act of civil disobedience last year, there were no arrests this time around.. .

Cernovich’s first dinner, dubbed “A Night for Freedom,” brought conservative personalities including Cassandra Fairbanks, Jack Posobiec, and Gavin McInnes to a dinner in Manhattan on the first anniversary of Trump’s inauguration. Declaring his first event a success, Cernovich set sail for Washington for the next installment of an event left-wing protesters have labeled an “alt-right party.”. . Lacy MacAuley, a local antifa organizer, denounced Cernovich’s gala as one put  together by and for “privileged white male elite.” With a history of protest against right-wing events in Washington, she announced plans to meet “A Night for Freedom” with an anti-fascist picket at the doors to the Gaylord - counter-programming she instead called “A Fight for Freedom.”. . “As a woman and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and sexual assault, I abhor these smug privileged white men who encourage their followers to rape women, who believe that women are inferior, who blame us for the fractured society their capitalist greed has created,”  MacAuley said in the press release where she originally announced her intent to meet Cernovich’s event with a “powerful presence of opposition to the fascists present.”. . “I encourage you to peacefully protest anything that I ever do,” Cernovich told News2Share in response to anti-fascist plans to protest his gala. “Do you wanna ruin your life? Don’t be violent. Do you want to protest me? Great. I’ll come say ‘hi,’ I’ll talk to you, I’ll give you a hot cocoa if it’s cold outside. You can yell at me whatever you want to yell at me.”. . What ensued on Saturday night ultimately proved wholly peaceful, albeit verbally charged. Despite the venue’s location remaining unclear until moments before it started, about two dozen black block protesters gathered outside the City Club in downtown Washington. They hurled insults at attendees, who periodically emerged - drinks in hand - to mock them and take selfies with the protest in the backdrop. A line of police officers separated protesters from the event-goers at the club’s entrance. . . Antifa protesters stood outside for over an hour deriding attendees with chants like “you want a red pill, how about a lead pill,” and “any time, any place, punch a Nazi in the face” - the latter referring to Richard Spencer’s infamous run-in with a masked protester last year. They repeatedly demanded to see Cernovich himself, though he never showed. “If he wants to bring me hot chocolate I would lead a chant: ‘we say no to fascist hot cocoa,’” McAuley later said. “I do not accept any extensions of an olive branch. I don’t need to talk to them, I need to shut them down.” . . There were no arrests or physical altercations, even though antifa protesters attempted at several points, unsuccessfully, to block people from getting in. A known member of group even attempted to gain entry to the event, only to be turned back. . . “I don’t think anybody noticed if there was an infiltrator, so they did a really bad job. Back in my days on the left when I would infiltrate things, I did far better,” said Cassandra Fairbanks, a right-wing journalist who attended Cernovich’s event. “I don’t understand why antifa decided to protest a party instead of protesting something like CPAC, where there’s actually neocons responsible for the Iraq War. But whatever, their priorities seemed a little screwed up for me.”. . They would later set up a mobile projector on the sidewalk, shining messages including “dismantle white supremacy” and “alt-right is wrong” onto the building while the event was held inside.. . .

Cernovich is planning a "Night for Freedom" while protesters are branding their event a "Fight for Freedom.". . News2Share will have a livestream at the protest tomorrow night.. . Cernovich says of antifa, "I encourage you to protest anything I ever do. I encourage you to hold your signs and call your names." He adds that he has experience getting antifa arrested if they respond to his work with violence.. . “As a woman and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and sexual assault, I abhor these smug, privileged white men who encourage their followers to rape women, who believe that women are inferior, who blame us for the fractured society their capitalist greed has created,” said Lacy MacAuley, an organizer with the DC Antifascist Collective. “In these times, it’s tragic that women must still defend our right to our empowered existence and full lives. But we will defend our rights. We will not accept the lie of our inferiority, let them keep abusing us, or let them send us back to the shadows. We will not let their oppression impact the lives of our daughters. No one gave women our rights. We fought for them, and we will fight again. This is a Fight for Freedom.”. . “They say they support freedom. No, they support maintaining the privileged white male elite that give them a sense of superiority. They seek to use their privilege to promote their power-obsessed, fascist mindset in order to subjugate others and maintain power,” said Andrew Batcher, organizer with the DC Antifascist Collective. “But we are what freedom looks like. They represent the fascist ruling class.". . News2Share will have a livestream tomorrow night at 5pm: facebook.com/N2Sreports. .

Candles dimly lit the sidewalk as people huddled on both sides of the highway for an evening vigil. Some held signs pleading with the NRA to “stop putting weapons in the hands of killers,” while others simply said “enough.” Anger and frustration over the status quo abounded. One person put it: “instead of love and prayers, let’s do action and change policy.”. . The Broward County Sheriff's office and the FBI fielded - and evidently overlooked - dozens of warnings about Nikolas Cruz's instability and intent. He was known to local law enforcement as a troublemaker, allegedly had a history of abusing women, and regularly posted photos of dead animals and weapons on social media. A YouTube comment posted last year under Cruz's name said he wished to be a "professional shooter,” and Cruz was easily able to acquire an AR-15 rifle even given a long history of mental illness.. . Despite all the red flags, 17 people - high school students, a football coach, an athletic director - lay dead after a sudden and chaotic rampage in the halls of another public school in America. It’ll reignite a cycle the country is all too familiar with: 19 years after Columbine, there will be calls for thoughts and prayers, politicians will squabble about what constitutes a solution and what misses the point, and invariably, the rage will subside from the headlines and the status quo will stand until another massacre someday reboots the cycle.. . The prevailing attitude this time around is that something needs to be done, somehow - but there’s disagreement on what that change would look like. Should the government restrict access to guns, or overhaul mental healthcare? Should they preemptively pursue and apprehend people harboring violent impulses, or do they solve a deficit in public security by simply arming everyone? Many Americans support different types of stricter gun laws, but not everybody is convinced that they would curtail America’s mass shooting epidemic.. . The hundred gathered outside the NRA saw gun policy reform as the best hope to break the cycle of violence. Some saw the NRA, the nation’s largest gun advocate, as complicit in the Parkland shooting by lobbying politicians like Florida’s own Senator Marco Rubio to block gun control legislation. . . Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly, after consoling emotional vigil-goers, expressed frustration with his colleagues’ inaction and floated three measures he called a start: an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and an end to the “gun show loophole.”. . Beside the podium, a friend of one of the Stoneman shooting victims wept. “I’m burying my best friend next week, I cheered with one of these guys,” she said. “Now I have to bury my best friend. I grew up with him, I lost one of my best friends because of something that could have been stopped.”. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. Article by Alejandro Alvarez. .

Re-publication of footage not authorized without permission. Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video. Photos and raw footage are available.. . (Skip to 22:00 into the video to see the procedure.). . Traywick - who has been infected with herpes for five years - volunteered as the first human subject to try a research compound produced by Ascendance Biomedical, a maverick biotech firm he founded and continues to lead.. . According to the World Health Organization, over half of the human race is infected with some form of the herpes simplex virus.. . Joined by a team of young researchers, Traywick inoculated himself on Sunday in front of a live audience to conclude the three-day BDYHAX, a "celebration of human enhancement, transhumanism, and biohacking” in Austin. Lab manager Gabriel Licina prepared the vaccine on location during a question-and-answer session.. . Traywick said his tentative cure works by interacting with the body's immune system and blocking glycoprotein D, a structural component of the herpes virus that allows for its entry into host cells. Andreas Stuermer, the project's lead researcher, will receive a version of the vaccine designed for infection-free individuals at a later date.. . "The procedure itself is a simple one," Traywick told News2Share. "If my herpes goes away, and the vaccine remains detectable in the blood upon subsequent lab analysis, we know it works as a cure. For Andreas, so long as the same happens, and he still doesn't have herpes, then we have 90 percent of the data necessary to prove the vaccine works.". . The serum is the culmination of a years-long research and development phase in a small shared laboratory space outside of downtown Austin. Traywick’s project is wholly independent, with no direction or oversight from academic or corporate entities - a maverick attitude its researchers prided themselves on, despite criticism from some over a lack of ethical accountability.. . “It's ridiculously faster,” Traywick said. “We set the pace, and we aren't constrained by anyone's desire to complicate the research and the developmental pipeline to profit. It gets us as fast as possible to the exact place independent and corporate investors would really want us to be - a place where we have raw, valid human data verifying the safety and efficacy of a given therapy.”. . Last year, Traywick’s experimental HIV gene therapy made headlines after volunteer Tristan Roberts self-administered the compound in a trial streamed exclusively by News2Share. That venture drew heat from the medical community, who raised concerns about unregulated self-experimentation.. . The Food and Drug Administration responded with a thinly-veiled swipe that, while avoiding specific mention of Traywick’s experiment, expressed concern about the safety of self-administered gene therapies and advised consumers to refrain from undergoing treatments not approved or studied “under appropriate regulatory oversight.”. . But production specialist Machiavelli Davis regarded the absence of a corporate or academic hierarchy as a strength, not a weakness. “Working with a tight knit team of passionate friends is also a far better experience than just being brought together because of a corporate job,” Davis said, noting that each of the team’s members had prior experience with self-experimentation.. . The results of the HIV trial are yet to be determined, but Roberts will proceed into his treatment’s next phase later this month by injecting a dose Traywick described as 250-500 times more potent than the first.. . As for Traywick, diagnostics on the effectiveness of the herpes vaccine start in two weeks. “We will be able to confirm the presence of the herpes and whatever concentration it’s at - if it’s moving, if it’s going up or down,” he said. “We’ll also be able to confirm the presence of the vaccine itself.". . With Stuerme also testing the vaccine soon, Traywick said a resolute victory would see both he and his friend virus-free.. . Support News2Share on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/FordFischer. .

With the exact route of the presidential motorcade a secret, protesters split into two groups and headed for opposite ends of the National Mall. Their hope was to cover the two likeliest routes from the White House to the Capitol - on Constitution and Independence Avenues - with a "greeting" the president would be hard-pressed to miss.. . On a cold and breezy night, about fifty protesters were tightly corralled by an unusually large police presence onto a corner at 3rd Street and Constitution Avenue, the closest members of the public could get to the Capitol on the north end of the National Mall.. . Motorcade after motorcade sped past protesters, who jeered the officials they escorted with loud booing and chants like "we need a leader, not a creepy tweeter" and signs - including a few with elaborate LED backlighting - referenced Trump's response to Puerto Rico, the Mueller investigation, and calls for impeachment. Local anti-fascist organizers were also present.. . About twenty minutes before the scheduled start of Trump's speech, a particularly long motorcade including the American-flagged presidential state car was met with yells of "fuck Trump" in unison.

Although police were stringent in keeping protesters off the roadway before and during motorcade passes, there were no incidents or arrests on the northern route.. .

One solitary pro-Trump protester from South Carolina held a Trump: Make America Great Again flag and a sign reading, "Mr. President, those that are for you, are greater, than those that are against you." About a dozen police separated the Trump supporter from the protesters for another half hour.. . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

Motorcade after motorcade sped past protesters, who jeered the officials they escorted with loud booing and chants like “we need a leader, not a creepy tweeter” and signs – including a few with elaborate LED backlighting – referenced Trump’s response to Puerto Rico, the Mueller investigation, and calls for impeachment.

Huddled around the frozen Reflecting Pool, marchers heard speeches from activists and politicians. They expressed a continued need for resistance against a presidency they denounce as racist, sexist, and a consequence of Russian influence.. . Saturday’s march occurred on the anniversary of Trump’s election rather than the original march’s date of January 21 - a source of friction with local organizers, who saw it as detracting attention from the 59 activists still charged with riot offenses following inauguration protests.. . The anniversary event was organized by March Forward Virginia, a spinoff from the national organization that began as the Women's March chapter in Virginia. It was part of a broader initiative called Power to the Polls which seeks to register new voters and promote women running for public office in advance of the upcoming midterm elections.. . After a short march to the White House, rally-goers laid thousands of signs and banners up against the White House security barrier and in Lafayette Square. Many shared a common desire to transition the annual march’s persistent turnout into a Democratic surge on the polls this November, with messages like "now we vote" and "these snowflakes don't melt, they vote" adorning the White House fence at the end of the day.. . As was the case with the original march, there were no arrests among the thousands who attended, and any tension was limited to brief arguments with sparse anti-abortion groups which set up with large posters at several points along the march path.. .

One of the most common is the belief that Muslims share a single united set of ideological or political beliefs. Those who believe this, most often believe that single set of beliefs is rooted in Sharia law.. . This journalist had the opportunity to interview a human rights activist at the recent march in Los Angeles. She has spent years attempting to warn people about the dangers of Sharia law and to protect people from the dangers of ideologies like it. Her organization supports interfaith, interracial, and gay marriages. It also supports ethnic, gender, sectarian, and sexual minorities.. . The activist’s name is Ani Zonneveld. Her organization is Muslims for Progressive Values. Yes, you read that correctly, Muslims in support of practices that are controversial to the American ring-wing. Ani’s organization makes a case for a difference between Sharia and Sharia Law. She actively speaks out for those whose voices go unheard or are in a country where they can’t speak freely.. . Today Zonneveld added what might be a huge wrinkle for those determined to paint all Muslims with the same brush.. . “We do not need an American Christian Sharia Law, people. There’s no difference between Christians getting voted in based on their Christian values and legislating for the rest of us. That is the same BS as the Muslim Sharia Law.”. .

This is an international movement, and its goals are diverse. Some seek to enhance the power of the mind using computers. Some enhance their body using radical technology. Others hope to defeat death itself. . . For the past year, News2Share has been filming experiments, demonstrations, interviews, and more to tell this story. We are pleased to announce that a half hour version of the film will be airing on the One America News Network (OANN) this holiday season.. . However, this is far from done. In a half hour,  one can only give a basic tour and some examples of the transhumanist movement in action. News2Share will continue its work to make a feature film that encapsulates a broad snapshot of the movement, and the sociopolitical questions it arouses.. . You can support our journey on Patreon.

But CODEPINK’s carolers weren’t interested in decking the halls with boughs of holly on Monday. Instead: “now’s the time to stop the killing.”. . CODEPINK visited Senate offices against a record-breaking arms deal with Saudi Arabia amid the ongoing Yemeni civil war and deepening proxy conflicts with Iran.. . Washington and Riyadh concluded the largest arms deal in American history in May, immediately providing the Saudis with billions in combat-ready equipment. Thousands protested the deal in the Yemeni capital, and a Saudi blockade imposed following an attempted missile attack by Houthi rebels stocked fears of a worsening humanitarian crisis.. . In an unusual move, Senator Rand Paul joined his Democratic colleagues in forcing a vote that would have blocked the new arms deal, citing Saudi Arabia’s lackluster human rights record. That effort ultimately failed after a 53-47 vote. Five Democrats defected from their party, siding with a majority of Republicans to ensure the deal’s survival.. . “We’re going to visit those five Democrats to say that if they’d voted the right way, it would have been a historic cut-off for weapons to Saudi Arabia,” said CODEPINK co-founder Medea Benjamin, who would later refer to those Senators as the “naughty five.”. . Among them were Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Bill Nelson of Florida, who have received campaign contributions from interests in the defense industry like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Benjamin and her fellow activists pressured those five Democrats to change their position, anticipating more votes over Saudi Arabia and Yemen down the road.. . Inside McCaskill’s office, CODEPINK’s small group of Santa hat-clad anti-war carolers asked to meet with McCaskill’s chief of staff. They were ultimately welcomed into a conference room by foreign policy adviser Nick Rawls, who agreed to meet with them on the condition cameras not be rolling because “we can’t control how that video is edited.”. . Benjamin said they discussed their opposition to McCaskill’s vote and touched upon her connections with Boeing, asking that the Senator release a statement condemning the Yemeni blockade and recognizing the “devastating humanitarian situation.” Three other offices also agreed to impromptu meetings, all on the condition that they be off-camera.. .

With the Senate’s approval of its own version last week, both houses of Congress are expected to convene and draft a final version of the bill that could be put up to a vote before the end of the year. Though Republican leaders have touted the bill as a return to conservative taxation and a job promoter, Democrats view it as unequally benefitting the wealthy over the middle class.. . The Senate version of the bill would also repeal the individual mandate from the Affordable Care Act, which detractors say could lead to higher costs for healthcare. The proposal’s impact on the ACA has been a key focus of activists over the past several weeks, many of which are returning to protest after the Republican effort to repeal the ACA over the summer.. . “Tax the rich, not the poor and sick,” chanted about fifty protesters packing the hallway in the Cannon building, who repeatedly said they viewed the GOP plan as little more than a scam.. . Earlier in the morning, about a dozen protesters with millennial-led climate advocacy group Sunrise Movement briefly occupied the office of two other Republican congressmen against a provision in the tax plan that would make portions of the Alaska Wildlife Refuge available for drilling operations.. . Entering the offices of GOP Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Patrick Meehan, they unfurled banners warning that the Tax effort “sells out the Arctic and our future,” and criticized the proposal as conducive to “climate chaos.”. . Additional protests are planned this week on Capitol Hill and across the country as the House and Senate meet to reconcile their versions of the tax bill.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The alt-right, which included Richard Spencer, Mike Enoch, and Matthew Heimbach, advocated for "Kate's Wall," a reference to Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant. Antifa proclaimed that they do not support Steinle's murder, but that "immigrants are welcome here.". . "It's not just about this one case," said Eli Mosley, the new leader of Identity Evropa, a prominent white nationalist group.. . Although harsh words were exchanged, police barricaded the two sides and swiftly escorted the right-wingers away from the White House. Richard Spencer escaped in a private van, while the others were followed by a police escort into Farragut Square Metro.. . Matthew Heimbach, leader of the National Socialist "Traditionalist Worker's Party," said he was happy that the police allowed both sides to speak, as permitted by the US constitution. He then clarified that he only supports the constitution "when it's convenient.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

The activists say that the prosecution is indiscriminate and includes journalists, nurses, and other observers and protesters who did not engage in violence or property destruction.. . "The trial of the J20 defendants is going to be a bellwether for the right to protest in the Trump era," said David Thurston. "The prosecution is asserting that simply because people assembled under an anticapitalist, antifascist banner and wore black, they can all be held collectively responsible for the actions of unknown individuals who may have broken a window or engaged in some form of property destruction." . . "Everyone should be really concerned about the theory that the prosecutors seem to be putting down." Gude Ortiz, a member of the Defend J20 Resistance organizing crew, says. "Basically that political organizing is conspiracy and that any kind of resistance to systems of oppression, capitalism, Trump, all these sorts of things are inherently criminal activity." . . Protesters say they were arrested to set an example, not for justice.. . "There's a conspiracy and it started when the police decided, before the protesters even left Logan Circle, that they were going arrest them," says Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights & Dissent. "Police rounded up 234 people in an unconstitutional, indiscriminate mass arrest based solely on their proximity to an alleged crime and based on the fact that they were participating in a protest.". . "If you allow state repression and continue to support politicians and city officials that support repression against dissent, you're only shooting yourself in the foot," said April Goggans of the DC Black Lives Matter movement to anyone in the right-wing watching the video. "And it means that your "patriotism" is a farce. You're a fake.". . A total of 194 defendants face 60+ years in prison, and the trials are expected to continue into late 2018.. .

After the session adjourned, Fischer ran a livestream with Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights & Dissent and National Lawyers Guild‘s Kris Hermes to get their take on the case so far.. . These are Ford's notes from the trial itself so far:. . Prosecutors acknowledge that they don’t have evidence showing any of these defendants personally doing any of the things they’re charged with, but they say they don’t have to. The charges are based on the notion of collective guilt and conspiracy. In a sea of uniformly dressed and masked rioters, one is guilty of property damage or assaulting a cop even if they didn’t throw the brick or rock that caused it.. . One journalist, two medics (one who is a nurse in her day job) and three alleged protesters each face 60 years in prison. The defense’s opening statements essentially all claimed something like “in this trial, you’ll see that people did bad things, but there’s no evidence my client did any of them.”. . Alexei Wood (the journalist)’s attorney pointed out that prosecuting his client on the basis of recording and saying commentary that was unfavorable to the government is particularly egregious, and added that “the government has is cell phone and everything on it, and they still have nothing.” He used the phrase “disagreeable is not illegal” to hammer down the point that the government is prosecuting someone for not liking what they report.. . The nurse’s attorney said that the government will keep trying to paint them as “a group” but her client will be found not guilty as an individual..  . The first government witness was an Au Bon Pain manager whose restaurant window got busted. Protesters did $5790.40 of damage to his business, but none of his testimony or video incriminated any defendants. Alexei was seen outside as the damage was taking place. Camera in one hand, phone livestreaming in the other.. . After, with the jury out of the room, the prosecutor argued that the specifics of an ACLU case shouldn’t be allowed to be discussed. There are allegations that police sexually assaulted arrestees, and the jury shouldn’t be allowed to hear that because it allegedly happened after the arrest, the state says. Judge agreed.. . Finally a uniformed cop took the stand. Officer Ashley Anderson, who was assigned to a civil disturbance bike unit, was in a squad of eight. She testified that while she personally witnessed property damage and had a rock thrown at her, they didn’t arrest individual perps because they lacked manpower. She described feeling “helpless.” They then played the bodycam video of her would-be injury.. . In an incredibly bizarre exchange, the government asked whether she had her firearm with her then. She said yes. They asked why she didn’t use it. She said that her “service weapon would not be appropriate because we don’t fire into crowds of people.”. . The judge released the jury until morning. Before adjourning, she described three words the court needs to define for the jury: “antifa, anarchist, and black bloc.” I have a feeling the activist community’s definition for these words will be different from the government’s.. .

Video contributed by Heather Mullins. . Right-wing and antifa groups faced each other for a second time in Boston on Saturday, as the "Rally for the Republic" brought out hundreds across both sides to Boston Common.. . Conservative groups organized the rally, headlined by popular right-wing figures including Kyle "Based Stickman" Chapman, as part of an ongoing effort following Trump's election to confront a perceived suppression of right-wing voices in liberal areas. Despite being denied a permit by the city citing traffic complications, organizers Resist Marxism and Boston Free Speech held steadfast, claiming a right to peaceably assemble under the First Amendment.. . "There's a systematic oppression of people of right-wing thought and ideology, by the city council, the police are involved in it, and the populace is involved in it," Chapman said, referring to cities like Boston and San Francisco as "Marxist enclaves." "We have to keep pushing back, wear our MAGA hats, let these people know we're conservatives, we're libertarians, we're nationalists, we're proud and we're not going to sit and hide in the shadows just because we're in a liberal city.". . After marching into the park from City Hall, police funneled about one hundred right-wing supporters past a considerably larger gathering of counter-protesters, including local anti-fascist blocs Bay State Red Sentinels and Bash Back Boston. Dual barriers of concentric fencing and a large contingent of police with bicycles separated the two sides during a rally which lasted about an hour.. . "We hope to disrupt this rally, they don't have anything to say here," said one masked antifa protester affiliated with Bash Back Boston, a group sharing a name with an anarchist queer collective which dissolved on the national level in 2011. "Boston doesn't want them. White supremacists are homophones and transphobes, we don't like them here.". . There were no clashes during Saturday's event. Boston Police arrested three counter-protesters shortly after the rally concluded. WCVB helicopter footage showed police lifting one protester, dressed in all black, out of the crowd following a brief scuffle. It is unclear what the three protesters were charged with. Over 30 protesters were arrested following clashes at the August free speech rally.. . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

Social media was filled with rumors of an "antifa uprising," all around an anti-Trump gathering by a decades-old communist group . Ultimately, a grand total of three people turned out in Washington.. . To start, some brief background on "Refuse Fascism." They're not an antifa group and there isn't a conspiracy for a hostile takeover of the federal government starting tomorrow. Refuse Fascism is very closely associated with the Revolutionary Communist Party, also called RevCom, both founded by far-left political activist Bob Avakian. The loosely-associated coalition of far-left activists we've been referring to as "antifa" typically trend more anarchist, while RevCom advocates for a Maoist revolution. Though it's very possible the two groups have some crossover in terms of membership, RevCom is not part of the antifa movement, and the group has a history stretching back decades. Notably, some DC-area antifa leaders refused to endorse the November 4 rallies.. . Refuse Fascism had been advertising their November 4 event for months as the beginning of the end for the Trump administration. It wasn't uncommon to be handed a flier advertising the event, or a communist newspaper, at several major left-wing protests in the capital over the last few months. Though Refuse Fascism had promised Occupy-style rallies in almost every major city across the country, oddly enough, Washington itself was left out of that list - an intriguing choice for a protest movement bent on bringing an end to the current government. There, however, a Facebook invite for a related invite that was, until sometime overnight on Friday, hosted by Refuse Fascism itself. As of publishing, it is unclear if the Washington event was officially organized by Refuse Fascism on the same level as others in New York or Austin.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer joined Washington-area activists outside the House on Wednesday afternoon for rally organized by the Tax March, the same grassroots organization behind the April 15 event that featured thousands coming out across the country calling on President Donald Trump to release his eagerly-awaited tax returns.. . What followed was  a three-hour, star-studded presentation arguing the failure of trickle-down economics, the unfair reign of the wealthy over the middle and poorer class, and the merits of a welfare-based system. Most speakers derided the new plan as favoring corporate rights over individuals and granting millions of dollars in giveaways to Trump's rich associates, spawning the event's title and chant of choice, "not one penny." . . “This is the biggest abomination I’ve seen in all my years in the Senate, and Americans will regret this bill for decades,” said Schumer, with the backdrop of the Capitol rotunda and a larger-than-life papier-mâché caricature of Trump himself. “This bill is like a dead fish: the more sunlight it gets, the more it stinks.”. .

"From California to Massachusetts to Washington, DC, adults should not be forced to live in fear," the protesters say. . . Activists gave out marijuana outside the HUD building as a form of peaceful protest. Although marijuana is a schedule 1 illegal drug under federal law, DC doesn't enforce this law on in its jurisdiction. Department of Homeland Security officers stood by on HUD property, ready to arrest anyone holding or consuming cannabis if they stepped toward the federal building. No arrests were made.. . "We're out here because we wanted to do a protest out here on Halloween where we were gifting cannabis. We knew it would be potent and so we wanted to shed a light on the fact that people living on subsidized housing in America are threatened with eviction on a daily basis," said marijuana activist Adam Eidinger, who led the effort to legalize marijuana in DC. "They are literally haunted in their own homes because they use cannabis.". . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

After charges were unsealed, Manafort turned himself in at the FBI field office in Judiciary Square, where he was processed and moved to the nearby federal district courthouse for his initial hearing. He pled not guilty on 12 charges, which included conspiracy and laundering, the most severe of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Rick Gates, an associate of Manafort, was also indicted.. . “There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort and the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government,” said Downing, briefly speaking to a large group of press outside the court building. “Today, you see an indictment brought by an office of special counsel that is using a very novel theory to prosecute Mr. Manafort regarding a FARA filing,” insisting that the charges, which stemmed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, were “ridiculous.” He spoke for two minutes and did not take questions.. . Manafort’s charges stem from his involvement with the Ukrainian government before his role in the Trump campaign. Prosecutors allege that Manafort failed to register properly as an agent of the Ukrainian government, and additionally funneled millions of dollars through overseas accounts to live a lavish lifestyle back in the United States without paying taxes. He now faces home confinement after posting a $10 million bond. His next hearing is scheduled this Thursday.. . Mueller’s first two charges did not appear to be directly connected to the Russia investigation, with no mention of alleged collusion with the Russian government in the 31-page indictment. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser brought on by the nascent Trump campaign, also faced charges on Monday morning for allegedly making false claims to investigators over the timing and extent of his relationship with senior Russian officials. He pled guilty in an apparent deal for leniency in exchange for cooperation in Mueller’s investigation.. . Video by Ford Fischer​. .

Washington’s Kurdish community renewed its call for the American government to intervene on behalf of their friends and relatives, pleading to the Trump administration that “it’s time to support your allies” against Iraqi efforts to quash independence. The same group that previously organized rallies before the referendum has now progressed to defending its results.. . "I ask my president Donald Trump to help us, please,” said Hiwa Raaof, who mentioned he had family back in the Kurdish region. “Help us - the Iranian state is using American weapons to kill Kurdish people.”. . The US has so far chosen to distance itself from the emerging conflict, expressing support for a “unified, stable, and a federal Iraq” in its response to the September 25th referendum, and cautioning against Kurdistan’s push for independence providing a distraction from efforts against ISIS.. . "It's unfair because we've been the biggest supporters of America, we've been fighting ISIS ourselves, and we just want to end American silence,” said Nashmin Behrouzi, holding a sign reading “your silence is supporting ISIS.” She added: “We just want a nation. We just want peace.". . Almost a month after an overwhelming vote favoring secession, Kurds have been drawn into a clash against an Iraqi state determined to reestablish its control over the semi-autonomous area in northeastern Iraq. In the last week, Iraqi forces - including American-trained units - have wrested control of Kirkuk province from the Kurds, with Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrawing following an intense battle with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Iran and Turkey, both home to sizeable Kurdish regions with their own independence aspirations, have also jumped into the fray.. . “The Kurds have been loyal and trustworthy allies of the United States,” read the event’s Facebook invite. “Abandoning our Kurdish friends now violates that trust and partnership and exposes the region and the world to the increasing threat of the Iranian regime and its violent, expansionist and anti-Israel agenda.”. . Kurdish protesters demonstrated outside the White House for about an hour, with chants including “We want Kurdistan, we want freedom, and “Iran/Iraq and ISIS are the same, the difference is the name.” They announced their intention for additional protests, including plans for a picket outside the Iraqi embassy in Washington on Monday.. .

Full story: http://news2share.com/start/2017/10/18/biohackers-produce-self-administer-attempt-at-gene-therapy-hiv-cure/. . The first self-administration of this therapy took place Tuesday night in Arlington, Virginia by test subject Tristan Roberts. Roberts has been living with HIV for five years and declined to continue traditional treatment for two.. . Bio-hackers are scientists that operate outside of the conventional research institutions, and often operate in gray or black markets. News2Share, along with a Netflix documentary crew, were given access to the experiment.. . The therapy attempts to use a plasmid  - a circular piece of DNA common in nature to transfer genes between individuals and even species - to grant the recipient the ability to produce N6: an antibody shown to destroy nearly all strains of HIV.. . "Essentially 1%, and really even less than 1%, of persons currently with HIV, for reasons that are aren't really clearly known, these persons developed a genetic immunity once they contracted the HIV," explained Aaron Traywick, CEO of Ascendance Biomedical. His mission, he says, is to share the 1%'s immunity "with the 99%.". . "I want to dedicate this to all those who have died while not being able to access treatment, even though those treatments were available," Mr. Roberts said before injecting himself with the therapy.. . The therapy attempts to supply the modified cells the ability to produce N6,  which is present in a minuscule sample of the human population.

Almost a week after the death of a young woman and dozens of injuries during violence surrounding the alt-right “Unite the Right” rally, a nationwide wave of protests continues to call for Confederate monuments to be dismantled. Statues in Durham and Baltimore have already met their end. Pressure continues to remove others memorials deemed by protesters to represent a bygone era of racism and hate.. . “We hate white supremacy, that’s the shit we’re here to dismantle,” said Lourdes Ashley Hunter, and area trans activist. “It impacts all of us - white people too.”. . The rally, attended by up to one hundred people, was cut short by a summer thunderstorm. A bottle of red paint was thrown at the base of the statue, quickly denounced by the rally’s organizers and afterward washed off by the rain and police. A crew of Daily Caller journalists were pushed out of the rally shortly after being covered in flour by one protester shouting “white flour!” The thrower then stood on stage, and appears at 1:45 in this video.. .

Jason Kessler, organizer of the "Unite the Right" rally, told reporters the event was a symbolic act, in solidarity with white people being "smeared" and "defamed" across the US and Europe. A sea of tiki torches suddenly overtook UVA, as hundreds were marshaled through campus with thunderous chants including "blood and soil, "one people, one nation, end immigration," and "you will not replace us." . . Toward the end, the alt-right completely enveloped a small counter-protest organized by UVA students at the foot of a Thomas Jefferson statue. Vastly outnumbered, the torch march encroached on the few dozen student protesters until tensions boiled over into clashes. One person was arrested.. . Filmed and Edited by Ford Fischer. .

They spotlighted Kathy Griffin’s controversial photoshoot involving Trump’s decapitated head, the shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise, and other “gruesome displays of brutality against sitting U.S. national leaders,” according to the event’s Facebook invite..  . “CNN, they’re a terrorist organization, they’re working with the deep state and the CIA to have you think that Mr. Trump is guilty of wiping his butt in the morning,” said a protester wearing a shirt featuring the Kathy Griffin shoot with the caption CNN = Terrorists. “Don’t believe the hype, ladies and gents, because we’re not gonna sit back and allow ya’ll to take Donald Trump down. I’d give my life for it, just like I’d give my life to truth.”.  . “This is a rally for peace. We’ve seen so much of the violence from antifa, so much violence from left-wing terrorists like James T. Hodgkinson,” Posobiec said, calling out the “normalization of violence” by works such as the 400-year-old Shakespeare classic Julius Caesar. Posobiec and his colleague, Laura Loomer, recently disrupted a New York production of Julius Caesar in protest of the Roman dictator being portrayed as Trump during its infamous assassination scene. Posobiec and others accuse Shakespeare in the Park of inciting violence..  .

Some waved Confederate battle flags, others national socialist flags, and a few the green flag of Kekistan, a digital “meme nation” born from the depths of anonymous image boards. The "Free Speech Rally" was in full force..  . They slowly gained in numbers until U.S. Park Police shepherded the group to the base of the monument, away from a growing left-wing counterprotest led by the International Socialist Organization. The two groups were separated by a series of barricades, and each managed to stay just out of the other’s sights, with the alt-right only briefly overpowered by distant chants of “go back to your mother’s basement.”.  . Though there were no physical altercations, a series of heated arguments between passing tourists and rally-goers attracted media and police attention, the later being quick to defuse tension before getting out of hand..  . In once instance, a pair of young women booed the rally from the sidelines, only for the alt-right to respond with “take a shower,” and “we get it, you’re lesbian, shut up.“ In another moment: “We set you free, we didn’t start slavery, we ended it, and you should be grateful for that,” said a man waving a Confederate flag, to an African-American tour guide. . .

When one protester spoke out against him, he told the crowd "someone get me a helicopter and throw the fucking communists out. Somebody go get a helicopter, pick this piece of shit up and drop him. We've had enough of your bullshit.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer . . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

"Free speech is only meaningful when you say something controversial and inflammatory. These people don't ultimately believe in free speech, they're ultimately cucks, they're ultimately wimps, they're also just honestly bad people," Spencer Explained. "I mean, if you meet Jack Posobiec, Mike Cernovich, they're liars, they're con-artists, they're freaks, they're not the people we want to be associated with. So I'm ultimately happy this happened. The alt-right will be better when we cut away these people that weigh us down.". . "If they're going to be these tedious little losers, then they can go fuck themselves," he added.. .

"For our rally at the Lincoln Memorial the uniting factor is freedom of speech. From me all the way down to Richard Spencer, people think you should have the right to speak your mind and you shouldn't be attacked for that," Invictus said, standing next to the statue of Confederate Captain Albert Pike.. . More speakers were originally planned for the Free Speech Rally, but many dropped out in favor of a secondary event after Richard Spencer joined. Asked about this division among the right wing, Invictus had this to say: "There's been a lot of infighting. These guys can't keep their eyes on the mission, and to me, that is a failure of leadership. Antifa can take a good amount of credit for that, because people are terrified of being called a Nazi. They are getting us to use our own tactics against us. You have to give credit where credit is due, and the antifa have made this a shit show today.". . As for whether he'd be intimidated by antifa showing up at the event itself, Invictus added, "If they show up and it's like Berkeley, we'll run them out of town... If they're stupid enough to attack us, which is what I'm hoping for, we will level them.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer and Alejandro Alvarez. Interview and Editing  by Ford Fischer. .

One group of activists, representing Black Lives Matter, blockaded the Pride parade near the main stage of festivities, shutting it down for two hours. Capital Pride staff were forced to scramble and reroute the parade while over 25 activists cabled themselves together across P Street near where the judges were staged to evaluate Pride floats. The activists refused to yield to demands to move aside.. . The activists staged their blockade just after the first few floats had passed. But as the DC Metropolitan Police Fraternal Order of Police union passed, activists jumped between police participating in the parade and their banner, cabling themselves together, and refusing to yield. Frustrated DC Capital Pride ushers pleaded with them to move so police and floats could pass. Back-up police moved in with barricades and police tape and videotaped the activists. There were no arrests.. . Black Lives Matter organizers called out DC Capital Pride on its corporate sponsorship, its marginalization of minorities in its parade planning, its acceptance of endorsement by MPD, and continuing business-as-usual under the anti-LGBTQ Trump administration.. . “MPD can’t continue to do what they do to anybody and not have us there,” said April Goggins, one of the blockade organizers.. . Their banner read ‘No Pride In Police Violence’ with language repeated in rainbow colors. Activists wore black pants and shirts with ‘Say Their Names’ in bold letters.. . A second blockade of the Capital Pride Parade was formed a few blocks away by war resistors, which also disrupted the procession for over an hour. Again police encircled the activists with barricades, while rerouting the parade a few blocks around it. There were no arrests reported at the second blockade either.. . Many Pride attendees chanted along with the war resistors as they firmly held their place, shacked together with bear traps. But other Pride attendees were upset by the blockades. Activists handed out pink flyers explaining their actions.. . A third blockade called out Capital Pride and its bank sponsorships by Wells Fargo and TD Bank. The third group of activists was also connected by bear traps and sat in the street, holding their ground while others held a banner reading ‘Wells Fargo = Native Genocide.’. . “It’s about taking back prides roots,” said Kayley Whalen, Digital Strategy Director of the task force. “A lot of pride’s message of activism and action has been swallowed up by a corporate pink wash,” she said.. . Whalen said that the main purpose for No Justice No Pride activists to disrupt the parade was that the corporate sponsorship interests have been hurting the LGBTQ community.. .

Hailed by environmentalists as a pivotal moment in cementing climate policy in global politics, the 2016 Paris Agreement faces an uncertain future under an administration whose stated policy is to repeal two regulations for every new one. The Trump administration stoked an uproar from environmental groups after appointing Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoma politician with a record of rejecting scientific consensus on climate change, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump’s campaign promise to cancel US participation in the agreement did little to assuage their fears.. . On Monday evening, Peoples Climate alerted activists and media via email that a decision on the climate accord’s fate was imminent. They promised a swift response to the rumored withdrawal, “in an action to wake up people to the climate crisis and the Trump administration’s failure to make action on climate a priority. It would involve a march into the Trump International Hotel’s lobby, organizers wrote, carrying with it a “startlingly loud” alarm clock which the group would use to wake up hotel guests - figuratively, and literally - to the dangers of climate of change.. . About 100 people began to organize in Freedom Plaza shortly after daybreak on Tuesday, ahead of a short march down Pennsylvania Avenue. Front-and-center was a human-size clock built of red and white cardboard, featuring a message soon to be delivered to groggy hotel guests - “Wake up to the climate crisis.” The march carried a distinctive clock theme signifying “the wake-up call they’re sending the President and his advisors,” according to a media advisory announcing the action.. . Protesters found little security outside the hotel entrance, and - without resistance from police - marched past a single barrier and occupied the area for about fifteen minutes. Though the clock itself remained outdoors, a small group of protesters masquerading as guests made it into the lobby where they sounded an air horn before being escorted out. There were no arrests or disturbances. At one moment, a man leaving the hotel briefly stopped to snap a photo of himself flipping his middle finger at the protesters.. . A second march led the group to the EPA, where they unfurled their banner outside an entrance and chanted “Scott Pruitt, don’t do it, save Paris now,” as workers exited from the nearby Metro station at Federal Triangle. “Be a man, Pruitt, show yourself,” one man shouted. Pruitt did not show himself.. . As of Tuesday evening, the decision has been delayed amid disagreements about the nature of the agreement, according to the White House. “It is important to up the ante and keep organizing and showing our power,” read the event’s Facebook description, “the first step is showing up Tuesday morning.”. .

On January 20, anger over a divisive president - blended with an increasing sense of desperation to fight back against a perceived tide of far-right nationalism - boiled over into a street war between the American version of the European extra-paramilitary Antifa (short for "Antifaschistische Aktion") and an amalgamated, multi-department police force.. . In the chaos and confusion that ensued, 230 people were swept up in a mass arrest in the vicinity of Franklin Square. News2Share witnessed one such arrest in which a large group of people, including several journalists and legal observers, were cornered into a curb by a large police force following damage to local businesses during an unpermitted "black bloc" action by a group called DisruptJ20, departing from Logan Circle southbound toward the parade route.. . It's now just over 100 days after Trump's inauguration, and the story of the inaugural mass arrests has by no means disappeared. In the days since, activists have had their homes raided by police, electronics confiscated, and have suddenly found themselves facing charges - in some cases, multiple - in connection with the January 20 unrest, months after the fact. DisruptJ20, having since reorganized under the name ResistThis, continues to call for the charges to be dropped.. . "On April 27th, a prominent local organizer was indicted with eight felony charges in relation to his involvement in the J20 protests," ResistThis said, in an April 28 email asking for donations to aid in legal defense. "Beyond bringing new defendants into this ongoing legal battle, MPD has also brought up to eight additional charges against other J20 defendants.". . This May Day, on the heels of a recent police raid and indictment against a J20 activist, ResistThis elected to continue pressure on city authorities by holding a rally outside the Superior Court of D.C. in which their trials are due to start sometime in 2018. Led by Sammi LeMaster, a local organizer, several dozen wearing all black blocked the courthouse's Indiana Avenue entrance, with chants including "masking up is not a crime," "drop the charges," and "if we don't get it, burn it down.". . Several marched over from Freedom Square following the conclusion of a May Day rally by area workers. They held the red and black flags characteristic of the Antifa network, as police formed a line guarding the entrance to the courthouse, later reinforced with a second barrier of bicycles. Despite brief clashes earlier between members of the same group and alt-right figure Jack Posobiec, during which the later accused an Antifa protester of assault, the rally outside the courthouse went on without incident.. . The rally demanded all charges against January 20 protesters be dropped, without exception, and vowed continued pressure against city officials until their demands are met. At one point, two young men exited the courthouse, mentioning to those gathered that they had been recently incarcerated. That resulted in chants of "all incarceration is political," and one of the men was given the megaphone, through which he expressed solidarity with the protesters and, ultimately, his wish that his tax money at least be used to improve jail conditions - "with my money, I should at least be getting spaghetti.". .

Posobiec used the "ok" symbol with his hand, which has been associated with right-wing values and "Pepe the frog" memes, which caused an altercation between him and Ivy.. . He reported the altercation to police, who initially handcuffed Ivy. Police ultimately decided that force was used by both sides and let Ivy go. Ivy may be called to appear in court if a judge later decides to charge them based on the evidence at hand.. . Ivy is a gender-nonconforming person.

The action was divided into five “blocks of struggle,” each representing a class of people impacted by systemic oppression and now finding itself at the forefront of a movement demanding climate action. Including “black struggle,” immigrant rights, and youth, each group put on a brief performance meant to capture and convey its struggle, and upcoming role in leading the People’s Climate March.. . “It’s important to talk about the impact of Trump’s agenda on people and the planet,” said Cindy Wiesner, a coordinator with Grassroots Global Justice. “We believe in divestment from the militarization of the budget – we need a divestment from fear and hate, we need a divestment from the corporate greed that we’re seeing.”. . Wiesner also attended the 2014 People’s Climate March in New York City, and said she noted a distinct sense of momentum in the three years leading up to its second installment tomorrow. “Our movement is moving,” she said, “we are growing, we are an unstoppable force of nature, we are seeing people come into the streets and stand with each other.”. . Like the Thursday action, the “red line” march was a non-violent action resulting in no arrests or otherwise illegal activity. A group of about a dozen young Trump supporters touring the Mall briefly stopped and jeered at the march, chanting “build the wall,” and were booed by protesters before continuing on without incident.. .

Central booking, where he was held from his April 10th arrest to the 15th.. . Kokesh was arrested by Secret Service outside the White House on an extraditable warrant out of Maryland stemming from an incident with TSA (Travel Safety Administration) in December 2015. The warrant was for failure to appear.. . Kokesh says his government-issued ankle bracelet from a previous gun charge was being additionally screened by TSA, and he remarked, "Don't worry. It's probably not a bomb." This resulted in the ten minute closure of the checkpoint and a criminal citation for disrupting security procedures. . . A January 2016 letter from TSA indicated that the agency wished to reduce their case to a warning. Kokesh believed this resolved the matter, while the government says the letter only frees him of civil liability. Maryland, meanwhile, is free to pursue the case criminally. . .

They marched to Trump International Hotel, led by a large inflated chicken caricature of Donald Trump, pausing there for chants and photos, and then on to the Lincoln Memorial.. . They called on Trump to respond to a variety of domestic financial issues, including cultivating government transparency, passing laws that close corporate tax loopholes, and creating tax equality for all.. . The family friendly event was organized by Tax March Organization and cosponsored by dozens of groups such as Americans For Tax Fairness and Progressive Tax Partner. . . “President Trump must immediately release his full tax returns, as all presidents and major-party presidential candidates have done for the last 40 years,” the Tax March Organization wrote on its web site.. . The site argued that a healthy economic system flourishes when all pay their fair share in taxes, revenue is shared, and government is transparent and responsible with discretionary spending.. . One protester wore a papier-mâché charactature of the President and posed for photos with disgruntled tax payers, while others posed for photos next to the tax chicken. . . Many carried hand made signs messaging Trump directly: “Grab Him by the 1040” read one sign, “Tax Cheeto” read another with pasted on Cheeto snacks pasted around a photo of Trump.. . The march ended at the Lincoln memorial, where hundreds laid their signs on the lawn nearby with grievance messages to the administration.. . One protester had a message for the the administration’s billionaire class president. “It’s customary for Presidents to release their taxes because there is a lot of potential for conflicts of interest,” said Danny Schaible, from Washington DC. “You’ve got a wealthy business person as president and I think it’s the public’s right to know,” he said.. . Tax day protests were held in over 25 cities across the U.S. In New York City pro-Trump counter protesters clashed with the tax day protesters, resulting in running brawls and 14 arrests. . . The D.C. protest was calm with no arrests reported. . . Please contact Ford Fischer at fordfischer@news2share.com or call (573) 575-NEWS to license video.

"Steve Bannon stands for Main Street, not for Wall Street, not for the globalists," said Posobiec, "he tends for the American people, the American worker.". . Though a previous event attended by Spencer resulted in clashes with antifacist counterprotesters, Saturday's "flash mob" was only met by a few black block protesters who did not confront those present.

Adam Kokesh was taken into custody prior to a planned protest on a fugitive of justice charge for failing to appear in court in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He did not show up for a 2015 criminal summons that caused a 10 minute closure of a Transportation Security Administration screening point at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.. . Kokesh was at the White House to protest the U.S. bombing of Syria, according to one of the protest participants. Heather Mullins said things were just about to begin when he was approached by Secret Service officers.. . Mullins said the TSA conducted an investigation into the airport incident and decided to let Kokesh off with a warning. However, the citation he was issued required him to appear in court in Glen Burnie, Maryland, which he apparently did not do.. . At a court appearance on Tuesday, a judge did not grant Kokesh bail and sent him back to jail. The judge cited Kokesh’s previous weapons charge for the shotgun, which he served four months in jail plus probation.. .

Spencer was leading dozens in a protest against the war in Syria, which the Antifa say is misguided because of his other views such as restricting immigration and ethnonationalism. “We absolutely oppose this war, as much as we oppose Nazis and fascism,” the protesters said.. . The protesters fought using fists, flag polls, and a glitter bomb. Spencer and his group attempted to flee in a taxi and the Antifa forced the cab open, starting a brawl on the street leading to two arrests. Spencer ultimately ran across the national mall with protesters on his tail and managed to hail a cab nearly two miles away.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Activist group WERK for Peace organized the latest in a series of dance actions bringing an LGBT twist to hot political issues, most recently against President Trump’s immigration orders and stance on transgender rights. Saturday’s display of intersectional activism involved a march on Ivanka’s recently-acquired DC residence, as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s home near Embassy Row, with the intention of protesting Trump’s recent reversal of several key Obama-era policies on carbon emissions and clean power production.. . Dancers made their way through the streets to Ivanka’s home where many chanted “Ivanka, come dance!” and danced to pop music waving flags and singing while closely watched by a permanent U.S. Secret Service security perimeter set up around the residence. . . “Ivanka, come dance,” chanted the jubilant crowd, as several of her neighbors came out to watch the party, some with wine glasses in hand. When Ivanka did not join to dance (notably, her three-story home’s windows were all shuttered and dark), the event’s organizer proclaimed by megaphone into the night: “It looks like Ivanka doesn’t really care about the queer or trans community, does she? What about climate justice?”. . To which the crowd replied by chanting: “Complicit!”. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Neil Wolfe is one of about a dozen people gathered along a block of small businesses in suburban Chevy Chase, MD, a town on the northwest border of Washington, DC. “You guys are nuts,” says one passerby, Wolfe fired back through his megaphone: “You’re gonna find out the truth, sir, and then you’re going to feel ashamed for calling us nuts.”. . The issue at hand is termed “Pizzagate,” a debunked conspiracy theory purportedly linking John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, and a number of other prominent political figures to a widespread child sex trafficking ring. Its subscribers, who self-refer online as, “investigators,” claim to have evidence that this ring runs covertly out of local businesses in and around Washington, most notably at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria on Connecticut Avenue.. . Despite being repeatedly proven unfounded by a number of sources including Washington Post, New York Times, and Snopes, with DC’s own police calling the accusation “fictitious,” this conspiracy remains an active discussion on anonymous online forums, including 4chan. The story made national headlines last December after 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch fired a rifle inside Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria frequented by area families. Welch later told police he was there to “self-investigate” the purported ring.. . “You have to understand that these are the most powerful people in the world that are engaging in child trafficking and child pedophilia,” said Wolfe, in response to a question about the lack of media and political interest over the ‘Pizzagate’ conspiracy claim. “They’re scared right now, and they control the media, so they’re going to do everything to marginalize us,” he said, “We are coming after you, we will not relent, and you better surrender.”. . After an interview, Wolfe cautioned News2Share Producer Ford Fischer against taking his words out of context, promising to make him “famous” if he did so. When Fischer informed him he was recording an unedited livestream in addition to his footage, Wolfe repeated: “Don’t take it out of context or I’ll make you famous, I swear.”. . (See here):. https://www.facebook.com/N2Sreports/videos/1338412416266644/. . Wolfe and his colleagues handed out brochures to pedestrians with screenshots of Instagram posts and leaked emails Pizzagate propagators cite as evidence. The group was frequently yelled and cursed at. One passerby briefly had a physical altercation with Wolfe, which was quickly broken up by a bystander. . . Area residents were less than thrilled at their presence. “If you care about children, you shouldn’t be supporting points of view that lead people to come here with firearms where my child goes to eat,” said one man after being offered a brochure.. . Across Connecticut Avenue on street corner, about four people, a couple masked, captured photos of the Pizzagate group from a distance through long telescopic lenses. When asked about their presence, one woman identified herself as “anti-hate” and said she was there to match faces to anonymous figures engaging in online harassment.. . “I just want to get some faces, because they’re just anonymous people on the internet,” she said,“they just assume everybody who doesn’t agree with their bullshit is a pedophile. That’s the new ‘communist,’ you’re a pedophile now.”. . “It’s not the red scare,” she added, “it’s the child scare.”. . Notably, Saturday’s event was not endorsed by Pizzagate’s main communication channel, where a moderator post discouraged the community from attending the event, citing a possibility of conflict and the “plentiful troll-fuel it would generate.” Another Pizzagate-related protest, likely to be somewhat larger, is planned near the White House on March 25.. .

On the heels of a nationwide spate of violence against the transgender community, particularly women and persons of color, organizers with the Casa Ruby LGBT Community Center, the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, and HIPS presented an opportunity for trans women to speak out about a threat to their wellbeing.. . “We don’t identify just as trans, we identify as human beings,” said an organizer, “we’re here to fight back and say, ‘we are human beings - respect us!”. . “In order to be relevant, you must honor humanity, and our current administration has shown that they do not,” said Elle Hearns, an activist with pro-LGBT rights group GetEQUAL. “It's not Donald Trump’s house, this is the house of DC. At the end of the day he can live in that house, but he is still in this city - you know, we’ll never belong to him.”. . Holding signs including a few reading “Respect existence or expect resistance,” and “Vive gente trans,” the circle of people, bundled in jackets and distributing hand warmers to fight back the cold, held a moment of silence for transgender victims of violence. They then read their names, each followed by loud calls of: “Say her name!”. . Video Produced by Ford Fischer. Description by Alejandro Alvarez. .

It’s mid-morning in Judiciary Square, a maze of government offices in the heart of the nation’s capital. Well over 2,000 people are gathered in the roadway in front of the Government Accountability Office, headquarters to the US Army Corps of Engineers. The strong scent of burning sage drifts through the poncho-clad crowd, huddled in shelter from driving sleet on the late winter morning.. . This is Native Nations Rise. Thousands gathered in Washington, DC on Friday, hoping to send the new administration a message that, despite setbacks in the battle against the Dakota pipeline, the fight for clean water and Earth goes on - it’s just changed place.. . “Our ancestors have inhabited that land for over 8,500 years,” said one Native American marcher about the significance of Standing Rock, “our writings are still on the rocks, we use the plants for medicinal and spiritual purposes - that land has a pulse, as does the entire Earth.”. . It’s been almost exactly a year since the struggle between the indigenous community and Army Corps of Engineers began at the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. Over 300 injuries and nearly 500 arrests later, the controversial Dakota Access pipeline is moving forward despite passionate outcry and, occasionally, even bloodshed. . . Native Nations Rise, billed as “Standing Rock’s next stand,” was a chance to vent that frustration while plotting a course forward for the indigenous rights movement and anti-big oil movements. Leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe issued a call to action shortly after Trump’s election and the revival of the Dakota pipeline project. And, despite the initially miserable weather, people answered. By the thousands.. . “Wake the hell up,” said Mike Willenborg, in DC by way of Detroit. Willenborg, a veteran of the 1960’s civil rights movement, drew comparisons between that struggle and the fight for Standing Rock, where he’d been months prior. “I’d tell the Corps that the cultures that were here before us are valid, and the property they own is valid,” he added.. . After a round of impassioned chants including “black snake killer” and “Mni Wiconi” - Lakota for “water is life” and the rallying cry for the anti-Dakota pipeline movement - thousands set off on a long march through downtown Washington for the White House. The sleet continued, but the march didn’t stop.. . A dozen or so activists with long wooden poles wrapped in white pieces of fabric worked their way to the front of the march on Pennsylvania Avenue. They sprinted up to the Trump International Hotel in formation. “We’re building a teepee,” they announced to media.. . Within minutes, a tall tent overshadowed the entrance. Marchers climbed statues and a nearby rally-owned bus for a glimpse of a Native American prayer dance at the doorstep to Trump’s DC property. Before long, they were on the march again.. . “What they’re literally doing is genocide,” said a woman of the urgency underlying Friday’s action, “as soon as that pipeline breaks, in 30 minutes or less, all of the water in the reservation is contaminated.”. . Marchers gathered in Lafayette Square outside the White House for a rally with a wide range of speakers, including indigenous activist Faith Spotted Eagle, who received one protest vote from Washington State in the electoral college. Others continued to peacefully protest in the park for hours after the march reached its final destination.. . “I’m fighting for native sovereignty, for cultural sovereignty,” said Carl Moore, dressed in traditional indigenous garments. “Native Americans have been trampled for years, this country is built upon oppression of Native Americans, of black people - globally, actually.”. . He added: “I'm here to fight for humanity.”. . Video Produced by Ford Fischer. Description by Alejandro Alvarez. .

This is Trump's second attempt after an earlier order was shut down by the courts. The protesters say that the new order is hardly better, and should be just as firmly opposed.. . Protesters' statement:. "Although it contains some minor differences, the policy outcomes and lived realities of the decision are still the same for people from the Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen), who were thrown into a state of despair just a few weeks earlier. Families were separated, children were detained for hours, and people were caught in a state of crisis, some while in transit.". . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

That was Tom Perez, newly-elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, speaking to a group of about one hundred protesters gathered on short notice outside the White House against another travel ban by President Trump.. After the demise of his first executive order amid heavy criticism by opponents branding it a “Muslim Ban,” Trump’s second attempt at fulfilling a top campaign promise repackages much of the inner workings of its predecessor. It includes a wide-reaching ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries - with a few notable exceptions for green card holders and travelers from Iraq.. “The first order was unconstitutional, and this order is unconstitutional - you can only put so much lipstick on a pig, it’s still a pig,” said Perez, who addressed the crowd along with representatives of the ACLU, CODEPINK’s Medea Benjamin, city officials, and others. An attack on one, is attack on all, chanted those gathered, echoing a common rebuttal by pro-immigration activists to arguments in favor of mass deportations and restrictions on refugees.. Monday’s action was organized on-the-fly, in a manner similar (though smaller in scale) to the outpouring of grassroots actions at airports around the country after Trump’s first order.. Though DC-area protests are normally held in close coordination with local law enforcement, especially when sponsored by prominent organizations, a disruption by police just after the event’s onset led to confusion. Citing a “security event” without offering specifics, U.S. Secret Service officers forced the rally into the northeast corner of Lafayette Square shortly after speeches began, vacating the recently-reopened portion of Pennsylvania Avenue behind the northern half of the White House. The event’s organizers chose to obey police orders, and there were no arrests.. A freelance videographer was briefly detained nearby for reasons unrelated to the protest, and ultimately released.. Another action against the new travel ban is planned early on Tuesday morning outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection building on Pennsylvania Avenue.. .

In a flash protest action organized by progressive activist collectives MoveOn.org and the Center for American Progress, about one hundred people gathered just outside the looming metal doors to the Justice Department on Pennsylvania Avenue around midday. Their message: “Perjury is a crime, Sessions resign” - and, in a co-opting of anti-Clinton at Trump rallies, “lock him up.”. . “We are experiencing a coup orchestrated by Vladimir Putin, executed by Donald Trump, and abetted by the Grand Old Party.”. . That was Robin Goree, who, as a retired Virginia attorney, had more than just a few strong words for the government’s embattled chief lawyer.. . “I took the same oath that Jeff Sessions took,” Goree said, “but I followed that oath. He’s betrayed his oath of office, he shouldn’t even be allowed to be an attorney.”. . Sessions initially faced criticism during his confirmation process for his past record on civil and voting rights during his time as a district attorney in Alabama. A report published by the Washington Post on Tuesday, however, reveals undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador which echo a recent controversy regarding Trump’s labor nominee Andrew Puzder - who ultimately withdrew from consideration under pressure. . . Sessions now faces similar calls, mainly from Democratic members of Congress, to either resign or recuse himself from investigating allegations of Russian collusion with Trump’s campaign.. . Over the course of about an hour, representatives from MoveOn, the Center for American Progress, and several members of Congress spoke to those gathered during an unfolding story that looks to be the latest obstacle for a troubled administration.. . For Marione Ingram, a holocaust survivor, Sessions represents a sinister movement in American society whose dark undercurrents are all too familiar.. . “I understand what fascism is, I have lived in it,” Ingram said, “I watched my family being murdered. I see a government that is using tactics that fascists use - oppression of people, vilifying, scapegoating lying, restriction of the press, voter suppression.”. . Sessions’ record in the Senate and as an attorney in Alabama, she added, stands as proof of his intention to undermine the human values that form a vital pillar of American society.. . “The fact is that we have an attorney general who is racist, is sexist, and a homophobe who, as a senator, not once voted in favor for anything that benefits human beings,” Ingram said. “When they say ‘Make America Great Again,’ what they want to do is go back to an era when lynching blacks west the norm.”. . As of press time, Sessions is scheduled to deliver remarks at Justice Department. President Trump told press he continues to have “total” confidence in Sessions despite the revelations.. .

Filmed by Ford Fischer. . Partial Transcript below:. . "And I want you all to know we are fighting the fake news. It's fake. Phony. Fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. There are no nine people. I don't believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said give me a break because I know the people. I know who they talked to. There were no nine people. But they say nine people. And somebody reads it and they say, oh, nine people, they have nine sources. They make up sources.. . They're very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people — the fake news. They dropped off the word “fake”. And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word “fake” out. And now I'm saying, oh, no, this is no good. But that's the way they are. So I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press. I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them, and I tell you, I love good stories, but we won't talk — I don't get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news media or press. Fake. Fake. They have to leave that word.. . I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being — let them say it to my face. Let there be no more sources. And remember this, and not in all cases. I mean, I had a story yesterday written about me in Reuters by a very honorable man that was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around, they are talented and honest as the day is long; that is great. But there are some terrible, dishonest people that do a tremendous disservice to our country, and to our people.. . They are very dishonest people, and they shouldn't use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before. You have no idea how bad it is because if you are not part of the story — and I put myself in your position sometimes because many of you, you're not part of the story — and if you're not part of the story, you know, then you sort of know if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.. . So when they make it up and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election — polls, polls. They come out with some of these polls — and some of them got it right. I must say, Los Angeles Times, shocking, they did a great job. We had a couple of others that were right. Generally speaking, I can tell you the network. Somebody said, "A poll came out." I said what network is it?. . And they'll say a certain — let's not even mention names, right? Shall we? Well, you have a lot of them. The Clinton News Network is one. Totally. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at their polls over the last two years. You'd think they'd fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered. I mean, who knows, maybe they're just bad at polling. Or maybe they're not legit. But it's one or the other. Look at how inaccurate. Look at CBS, look at ABC also. Look at NBC.. . Take a look at some of these polls. That were so bad, so inaccurate. And what that does is it creates a false narrative. It creates this narrative that it's just like we're not going to win. People say I love Trump but I'm not feeling great today. He can't win, so I won't go and vote. It creates a whole false deal, and we have to fight it, folks. We have to fight it. They're very smart, they're very cunning, and they're very dishonest.. . So just to conclude, it's a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment. They always bring the the First Amendment. I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody — who uses it more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us — it gives it to me it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans — the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.. ...". .

Say Activists</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Feb 8, 2017</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Protesters gathered Wednesday evening at Lafayette Square in front of the White House to show Donald Trump that "he won’t be able to build this pipeline without a fight." With The Army Corps expected to issue the final federal permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline, activists leaders renewed their commitment to continue protesting the controversial project.. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. . Statement from Tom Goldtooth, Executive Director of the Indigenous Environmental Network:. . “Donald Trump will not build his Dakota Access Pipeline without a fight. The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight — it is the new beginning. Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far.. . “The granting of this easement goes against protocol, it goes against legal process, it disregards more than 100,000 comments already submitted as part of the not-yet-completed environmental review process — all for the sake of Donald Trump’s billionaire big oil cronies. And, it goes against the treaty rights of the entire Seven Councils Fires of the Sioux Nations.. . “Donald Trump has not met with a single Native Nation since taking office. Our tribal nations and Indigenous grassroots peoples on the frontlines have had no input on this process. We support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and stand with them at this troubling time.”. .

Islam has never been our enemy.”. . Thousands are huddled together on a cold Saturday morning in downtown Washington just steps from the White House grounds. Nearby, construction crews are busy at work dismantling the looming wooden structure that weeks ago served as President Trump’s inaugural parade stand.. . “I’ve been in refugee camps with Syrian families,” continues Bella, an 18-year old aid worker speaking through a loudspeaker aimed toward the White House. “Did you know that one of the five pillars of that religion is charity for the poor,” she asks the president. “This is a country that was built upon people seeking refuge from religious persecution. Why is today any different?”. . It’s day 15 of the Trump presidency, and a cohort of young activists and concerned citizens are already calling for the newly-elected Trump to be reprimanded or impeached. The latest cries for action, however, are not for those who are already here, but for those who want to be - or, in some cases, desperately need to be.. . “You’ve blocked immigrants from trying to enter the country. A lot of them are trying to escape their country. By not letting them take refuge here, you are letting them get killed.”. . That was Maddie. She’s 11, and she had just a few words for Trump on his recent executive orders barring immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, throwing hundreds of asylum-seekers - many fleeing life-threatening situations in their homelands - straight into political chaos.. . What began last week as a massive lightning-fast response to Trump’s sudden edict at thousands at airports across the country, has kept up momentum by pressuring elected officials through mass phone calls and consistent actions on the streets. Today’s action in downtown Washington was one of the biggest in the city since that order went out, this time organized by volunteer group Peace for Iran. It’s a sure sign that opposition to it shows little sign of abating anytime soon.. . Thousands set out down the entire length of Pennsylvania Avenue, bringing with them chants including “You build a wall, we tear it down,” and “Donald, can’t you see? You’re not welcome in DC.” A sea of protest signs blanketed blocks of Pennsylvania and Constitution all the way to the east side of the Capitol, with many marchers notably wearing the pink hats that became an icon of the record-setting Women’s March last month.. . Along the way, they shared hopes for peace and unity bundled with a warning that the recent political upheaval seemed a eerily familiar.. . “I’m out here today to show my respect for the community and show how we can all defend our religion and our rights,” said a young Muslim girl protesting with her family outside the Capitol. “Every religion is welcome in every part of the world, and everybody is human no matter what  their religion or race.”. . “I study a lot of World War II history, and it’s so reminiscent of the way that Hitler rose to power,” said Samantha Behlog, one of the protesters hoisting up a long banner at the front of the march reading No Ban, No Wall. “The way that he’s just gone drumming up fear - making it so being prejudiced and racist is more accepted, it ends up going down a really, really dark road that we’ve seen before.”. .

The groups met at the Trump Hotel and paraded to the White House, dancing and singing to a loudspeaker on a truck.. . "Our hips don't lie and never had to," the protesters explained.

For the second time in a month, LGBT activism group WERK for Peace held a dance party in Washington, DC as an act of peaceful resistance featuring glow sticks, rainbow suspenders, and glitter (“it’s biodegradable,” the event’s organizers emphasized). News2Share Producer Alejandro Alvarez covered the group’s first action the night before Inauguration Day, a similar dance party which worked its way through suburban northwest DC to then-VP elect Mike Pence's temporary residence following criticism over his stance on LGBT rights.. . Friday’s action, billed as an event “celebrating intersectionality and resistance” in solidarity with Trump’s recent motions against immigrants and refugees, played out in much the same way: a festive rally with dancing, singing, and a sea of rainbow flags and headwear outside Trump’s DC hotel, followed with a dance-off down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The group’s pickup truck, crowned with Christmas lights and adorned with a cardboard billboard adorned with “#DanceTrumpsHate,” blasted music along the whole parade route to the Secret Service’s security perimeter at Lafayette Square.. . “We don’t need #AlternativeFacts,” the group wrote on the event’s Facebook page. “Instead, we embrace and honor the beautiful, magnificent truth of our intersectionality … an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.”. . Apart from the party itself, a number of makeshift signs and caricatures notably mocked recent “Trumpisms” made by the newly-inaugurated president. One man carried a rubber Trump mask on a pole complete with a suit, little hands, and flyaway hair - bundled together with a sign reading “Keep your tiny little hands off our rights.” He got a number of photo requests.. . “If we’ve figured out one thing, it’s that vanity and ego is the way to this guy,” said its creator. “Maybe he sees a picture, maybe somebody else picks up the tiny hands. He’s a child.”. . Harald Fuller-Bennett, a DC-area resident, danced with a cape featuring the revolutionary-era Gadsden flag superimposed with the LGBT color flag. Though the Gadsden flag saw a resurgence in the modern era as the rallying banner of the Tea Party movement, Bennett said its roots in the founding of the country were relevant to resistance against Trump. . . “The Constitution is our strongest weapon against Donald Trump,” said Bennett.. .

Climate activists and members of the indigenous community made a rapid-response call to action almost immediately after Trump’s televised signing of an executive order resuming the Dakota and Keystone pipeline projects. Both pipelines had spurred protests across the country before being rejected by Obama, citing the need for additional environmental impact assessments.. . The protest’s Facebook event had gathered over 1,000 RSVPs within hours, with some participants crediting the rapid momentum to increased interest in activism following the Women’s March less than a week earlier.. . “Join us tonight as we stand with indigenous leaders and climate activists,” organizers wrote on Facebook, “commit to the fight ahead and show that these pipelines will not be built without a fight.”. .

This video, produced by News2Share's Ford Fischer (but not in association with News2Share) was screened at the National Press Club on Tuesday. It was produced for Anne Folan & Associates and BirkdaleMedia (to whom it is copyrighted and available online with permission).. . Ms. Abbas, who is on a private tour of the US, meeting senior officials from the State Department, the World Bank/IMF, members of the House and Senate from both parties, and Washington think tank leaders, called on the Trump administration to look beyond military and intelligence options and focus on the anger and discontent among the people in Pakistan's impoverished provinces. . “If there is no war against illiteracy, no war against poverty and no war against inequity, then the war against terrorism will continue to be a battle unconquered,” she said. “Illiteracy is the breeding ground for terrorism.”. . President Donald Trump “needs to have an open mind,” she said. “Pakistan and the U.S. need to be allies.”. . Monday night, during a meeting with leaders of the U.S. Pakistan Women’s Council, Ms Abbas screened a video of her being fired on, arrested and detained at a peaceful protest in Pakistan last November. That video will be screened and made available at her news conference later today. . . On her US tour, she has previously met with senior economists at the World Bank/IMF and presented a strategy for "slaying the hydra" - the multi-headed monster of poverty, corruption, and terrorism.. . Andleeb Abbas is deeply concerned about the new revelations from the Panama Papers scandal, especially the documents released Monday by German investigative journalist Bastian Obermayer which confirm that the Pakistani Prime Minister and his family were the owners of billions of dollars of property hidden in the tax havens of Panama. Pakistan's Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments about the admissibility into evidence of Panama Papers documents. In her meetings Ms. Abbas has emphasized the link between corruption and terrorism and has appealed to the new administration to demand accountability and transparency in its dealings with Pakistan's ruling regime. . . From Washington, Ms Abbas will travel to Boston to address the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, and for meetings in New York, before returning to Washington to guest lecture at National Defense University at the end of January. . .

Washington, DC, Dirsken Senate Building - Outside EPA Nominee Scott Pruitt's Hearing. . About 75 people showed up Wednesday morning to protest the confirmation hearing of EPA Nominee Scott Pruitt. Protesters lined up for outside the hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, where speakers from the Sierra Club, 350.org, and Food & Water Watch came to speak. Three were arrested.. . Activists were not allowed to make noise inside the building and were not allowed to enter the hearing itself.. . A woman from the Lakota tribe spoke up, asserting that Pruitt's efforts were in violation of a tribal treaty.. . She began to pray publicly and was arrested for "disrupting the peace." As she was arrested, a second activist attempted to hug her and was also arrested. A total of about six police officers were involved.. . Minutes later, four police officers escorted Diane Wilson, a Texan shrimp farmer who says her career is jeopardized by Pruitt, out of the hearing. She described herself to the crowd as "basically a bankrupt shrimp farmer." Others tried to get into the meeting, some with signs reading "STOP PRUITT.". . Ray Scheinman told News2Share (written verbatim): "everything was chaotic and hectic, but it seemed like everyone waiting to have their voices in the hall agreed with us, as we gained a nod of approval from not only Tim Kaine, but Lindsey Graham as well. Some individuals lined up to sit in the room wore our stickers to demonstrate support in the room. It was evident that those trying to exercise their rights in a public hearing were not admitted or were promptly thrown out". . Note: This footage was contributed by Ray Scheinman.

That was the message that Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow sought to deliver to the Jewish Presidents' Conference, an umbrella group vouching for 51 national Jewish organizations, opposing its plan for a Hanukkah celebration at Trump's DC hotel. . . "We will build this world with love," about 300 protesters chanted in both English and Hebrew, marching from Freedom Plaza down one side of Pennsylvania Avenue to the nearby Trump Hotel against what they deemed an act of "cowardly normalization" by the Jewish establishment.. . The march comes as some  of Trump's prospective cabinet officials and top advisers face criticism for remarks seen as anti-semitic or embodying white nationalist ideals. Steve Bannon, Trump's soon-to-be chief strategist, spearheaded ultra-conservative outlet Breitbart's anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and pro-Trump platform. He was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League last month. . . "I believe that Steve Bannon is a white nationalist, and it's very dangerous to have him in the White House," Rachel Goldstein, a grassroots organizer with IfNotNow, told us. "We believe there's no place for white supremacy in Judaism, it's corrosive to our Jewish values. That's why we're here today - we believe our message is one of Jewish values.". . Off to the side, a far smaller group of about a dozen Trump-supporting counter-protesters sang "God bless America," holding identical signs reading "Jews choose Trump." A few ventured into the neighboring protest, where they argued with demonstrators about IfNotNow's opposition to Israel's stance on Palestine.. . "If you don't like the expulsion of non-Jews from Israel, that's fine, don't celebrate Hanukkah," one of them told me - a young Trump supporter who would only identify himself to my colleague as "a northeastern Jew." . . "They [IfNotNow] are part of a disingenuous and slanderous attempt to defame and discredit Donald Trump as a racist and an anti-Semite that has no basis on reality," he added.. .

Hundreds of “Jewish Resistance” movement protesters marched Wednesday night from Freedom Plaza to Trump International Hotel in Washington DC to demand the cancellation of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organization Hanukkah Party at Trump Hotel.. . The protesters say that they oppose “the American Jewish Establishment's cowardly normalization of Trump, Stephen Bannon, their anti-Semitic movement, and 50 years of occupation.”. . The group, which calls themselves “IfNotNow” is a movement of young Jews “organizing to end our community's support for the Occupation and demand freedom and dignity for all Israelis and Palestinians.” . .

"We will not submit, we will not comply," chanted protesters on Pennsylvania Avenue before a rally and speak-out in Lafayette Square.. . "We got punished by the government. At the registration, my family was abused and humiliated. We were put into deportation proceedings and later, my home was raided by immigration authorities, who took me, my husband, and my daughter into detention even though we had a pending asylum claim. My daughter and I were detained for eleven days, and by husband was detained for six months.". . That was MoveOn's Iram Ali, describing the experience of an anonymous immigrant and her family under the Bush-era NSEERS program. She spoke to a crowd of 100 gathered near the White House, following a march from the Justice Dept. down the heart of Pennsylvania Avenue.. . NSEERS was a non-citizen registration program concocted during the post-9/11 security crackdown. It faced rampant criticism from immigrants rights activists who flagged the program as a front for ethnic profiling, spreading fear and intolerance instead of its original aim of catching terrorists - which it never successfully did.. . "Discriminatory enforcement is illegitimate and its effects must be corrected," the ACLU said in May 2011, in its statement applauding the program's indefinite suspension that April. . . It's 2016, and we now know that the next administration is mulling shoving NSEERS back on the table. In what form, nobody knows. It took a photographer with a particularly long lens to find out this was even part of the plan.. . But coupled with Trump's loud campaign rhetoric about selectively banning Muslim immigration "until we can figure out what the hell is going on," immigrants impacted by NSEERS - the closest thing this country has ever had to a mandatory registry based on religion or ethnicity - are already mobilizing.. . “We need president Obama to give us a fighting chance,” an activist said outside the Justice Department. “Dismantle the regulations - we must prevent a repeat of the special registration.”. .

Mr. Fotheringham is the author of the book, The President Makers: How Billionaires Control US Foreign Policy. . . He is a graduate from the University of Utah with a degree in political science.  As the Cold War escalated, Don realized that freedom won on the battlefield was being lost in Washington.  He realized that America's foreign and domestic policies were in serious violation of constitutional limits on the power of government. . . That's when Don "enlisted" in a whole new kind of war — a war to alert his fellow citizens to questionable loyalty in high places and threats to the U.S. Constitution.  . . In 1983 Mr. Fotheringham discovered a well-organized movement to hold a new constitutional convention.  He was alarmed because such a convention can make unlimited changes in the Constitution. He found that 32 of the 34 states (the two-thirds required to trigger a federal convention) had passed legislation for a convention on their intent to get a Balanced Budget Amendment added to the Constitution. . .

Full Clip Transcript:. . "It is important to recognize what’s going on in this election. Everybody whose ever been in an election that I’m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates. And on the other side, there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know,  go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that they deeply feel. So as a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right. And I don’t have much company there. Because it is difficult when you’re running to be president, and you understand how hard the job is —  I don’t want to overpromise. I don’t want to tell people things that I know we cannot do.". .

Congressman Raúl M. Grijalva and Congressman Raul Ruiz held a forum Thursday on protecting native land and resources, urging federal agencies to pull back permits they have already issued for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.. . All the way from Standing Rock, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault, tribal leaders, youth, and respected elders remarked on their efforts to protect the rights, health, safety and culture of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Lakota nations in North Dakota.. . Rep. Raul Ruiz calls on the Army Corps of Engineers to comply with their legal trust responsibility to protect tribal lands and cancel their flawed Dakota Access Pipeline permit. He calls for them to conduct meaningful consultation with the tribes and that they do a complete environmental impact statement.. . Harold Frazier says there’s a big issue with consultation between developers and tribes. “A lot of times when we go and meet with Federal Agencies, we come with authorities from our tribal council to negotiate, and a lot of times, there’s no decision makers sitting across the table from us. Many times, as a matter of fact all the time, they tell us they’ll get back to us but they never do,” he says.. . "This conversation today impacts people who will be born generations from now.". . Faith Spotted Eagle, Ihanktonwan Oyate Spiritual Leader and Elder, begins her statement by saying she would like to give her thanks to the congressional relatives there. “I’d like to exert my senior status by making all her relatives be those who come from Mother Earth, so you are all my relatives here today. This conversation today impacts people who will be born generations from now. I’d like to begin by acknowledging that an entire realm of indigenous thought is marginalized, deemed unknowable and consequently left out of every serious decision. It’s important to notice that a holocaust happened here in this country. We are now experiencing it on the Missouri River, the lifeblood of our people and home to 8 million other human relatives.”. . “This is not just a Native American Issue, this is a human race issue. We’re doing this to protect our human race because without water we can’t survive,” says Gracey Claymore. Gracey is a 19 year-old member of the Standing Rock Youth Council. She was moved to tears during her statement about how beautiful the lands of Standing Rock are and how important they are to her. “We’re doing this so they [the future generations] can have a future. They deserve clean water.”. . Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, reassures the tribes they’re not alone. “I wish we were having an official hearing,” he says. The representatives agree that an official bi-partisan, on the record hearing, is needed with Democrats and Republicans together. “Unfortunately we don’t have many republicans that will ask hard questions and stand up to big oil.” Congresswoman Norma Torres, agrees that there needs to be more involvement from Republicans. “Everyone here today will do everything they can to make sure we get this right,” Pallone concludes.. . "The fight against Dakota Access is far from over.". . Deirdre Shelley, organizer for 350 and 350 action, joined a group of over 20 people to show up to the forum in solidarity. She says having so many people join goes a long way -- it shows decision makers in DC how much momentum the fight has. But more importantly, it lets folks on the ground in North Dakota that they have the strength of a movement behind them. “The fight against Dakota Access is far from over -- and I'm sure there will be key calls to action in the coming weeks. So proud to be part of this fight with all of you!”. . The activism surrounding this issue has spread across the country.

Noticeably absent from Fiorina’s address was an endorsement of the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, though Fiorina did criticize prominent members of the Democratic Party.. . Fiorina opened her remarks by stating that “feminism is… no longer used to enable or empower women” and claiming that the movement has been coopted by presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for political purposes. Fiorina argued that Clinton and other progressive democrats wish to expand the reach of the federal government. She claimed that “progressivism is tyranny of few over many” while naming several progressive Democrats such as President Barack Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and Clinton.. . Fiorina continued to explain her opinion on the purpose of government in the United States by stating that America is a nation of equal opportunity. Interspersing personal narratives during her speech, she referenced the nation’s founding documents to make the argument that the rights granted to citizens come from divine authority. Fiorina noted that during her period as a candidate for president she experienced several intimate moments with U.S. citizens. She stated that she witnessed ‘feelings of powerlessness’ in those people she encountered.. . As an extension of her criticism of the federal government, Fiorina said that “work brings dignity, family brings purpose and faith brings meaning to our lives” to express her view that every U.S. citizen is equal. She expressed her opinion that power had become too consolidated in the federal government and needed to return to smaller entities like states and individual citizens. Additionally, Fiorina stated her plans to assist in the campaigns of many Republican leaders in November, however, the former Republican candidate did not mention any intent to assist Trump in his bid for president.. .

During the speech, Trump was interrupted by a group of protestors from Codepink: Women for Peace.. . Trump examined many issues important to the party base including the spread of radical Islamic terrorism, abortion rights and immigration. During his remarks on the spread of Islamic terrorism, Trump noted his plans to expand the American alliance with Israel and his view that Syrian refugees should not be granted immigration to the United States. Trump also stated his intentions to “uphold the sanctity and dignity of life” by taking a pro-life stance on abortion rights. Finally, the candidate vowed to create a jobs program for inner city communities while also defending Christian Americans from governmental regulation.. . Trump also launched attacks at his likely general election opponent Hillary Clinton.  Clinton was attacked on both her policy proposals and her past. Trump criticized her stance on refugees and the profits she and Bill Clinton made by delivering speeches to special interest groups. He also questioned Clinton’s work as Secretary of State by saying that the “Iran deal [was] one of the worst I’ve ever seen” and claiming that she would not attack radical Islam. Additionally, Trump also went after Clinton by stating that she wanted to abolish 2nd Amendment rights for American citizens and by referencing the controversial investigation centered around her private email account.. . During Trump’s early remarks, protesters from Codepink, led by activist Alli McCracken, interrupted the candidate’s remarks with chants of “God hates Donald Trump” and “Refugees are welcome here”. The speech was halted for several minutes as the activists were escorted out by event security. . . Filmed and Edited by Ford Fischer.

Baltimore and Freddie Gray are back in the news this week, with the start of the trial of one of the officers facing charges over his death.. . “You all look great, the end of the Republic has never looked better,” was Obama’s opening joke, which got a chorus of hearty laughter at what the president quipped was perhaps “my last and perhaps the last White House Correspondents Dinner.”. . One year ago, as the WHCD (aka “Nerd Prom”) got underway in Washington, just an hour’s drive north angry young people smashed cop cars and looted stores following the passing of Gray, who’d suffered a broken spine in the custody of the Baltimore police department after an arrest for allegedly possessing an illegal knife. At the time, the glitzy celebrities and overdressed journalists were blissfully unaware of the rage up I-95, unless they were flipping through their phones on Twitter.. . Video journalist Trey Yingst, working independently, and myself, reporting at the time for Al Jazeera America, were both there last year, covering the civil unrest and the community’s response to it. From many outraged residents of the area, we heard deep distrust and hostility for the media, who West Baltimoreans feel only show up to showcase chaos and violence. We went back to see what had changed over the last year, and what we found were residents fed up with the American media’s depictions of their neighborhood as violent, crime ridden and hopeless.. . The portrayal, residents say, makes them feel like nobody cares or hears them. To one young Baltimorean, Deandra McNeill, 15, that was the original reason for the unrest — and perhaps the reason for the next.. .

Protesters assembled outside and claimed that Yiannopoulos represents hate speech against minority groups, particularly transgender people. . . As Yiannopoulos began speaking, he explained that he would donate $20 to Donald J. Trump every time he's interrupted. Within the first minute, a protester with a sign stood up and was promptly removed by campus police. The sign read "Roses are red, violets are blue, Milo we're too woke [sic] to tolerate you.". . As she was removed, another stood up at her seat with a sign that read "Hate Speech ≠ Free Speech." She remained in place in silent protest for the entire event.. . As the Q&A came to a close, one man went to the microphone and asked, "How do you equate the Black Lives Matter movement with black supremacy?" Yiannopoulos supporters began yelling "Trump!" and "Black privilege!" as a shouting match ensued among various wings of the audience.. . Yiannopoulos refused to answer. "You're standing up and expecting special treatment now sir. Questions are over. You're demanding to be heard on the basis that if I don't answer you're question, I'm racist. Sit down.". .

Noted for his divisive language particularly dealing with minorities, News2Share's Ford Fischer asked whether alienating groups makes it harder to bring people into his point of view.. . "I Don't Give a Shit What You Believe," Yiannopoulos began. He explained that he sees himself as a "hell-raiser" like Donald Trump or Ann Coulter and that he sees this as more useful than an inclusive ideology.. . "I'm well aware that my style is not going to win over everybody, but that's not my function.". . Fischer then asked Yiannopoulos, "Do you actually believe the stuff you say?". .

The interview occurs amidst a civil disobedience action where activists, including Forchion, smoked marijuana in front of the White House.. . His case centers on four main questions:. . 1) “Are New Jersey’s drug laws inherently discriminatory against African Americans and discriminatory as applied by law enforcement?”. . 2) "Has New Jersey decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with other state courts of last resort as petitioner was precluded from arguing to the jury by way of nullification that marijuana should not be a substance proscribed by New Jersey as part of his defense at trial?". . 3) "Is a state court of last resort in hopeless conflict with the United States Court of Appeals concerning First Amendment Free Exercise Clause as it relates to the right to use marijuana as a religious sacrament?". . 4) "Does New Jersey’s criminalization of marijuana deprive Rastafarians of their sacramental use of cannabis in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act?". . The Supreme Court only takes a small fraction of the petitions it receives each year.. . Forchion's full petition can be found here:. http://www.njweedman.com/USSUPREMECOURT_NJVSFORCHION_PETITION_FOR_CERTIORARI.pdf. . Filmed by Ford Fischer. .

Billed as a “mass consumption of cannabis” by organizer DCMJ, the District area’s largest pro-pot advocacy group, one of DC’s most popular tourists attractions quickly transformed into a scene reminiscent of a reggae concert.. . Demonstrators lit-up en mass at exactly 4:20 p.m., after dozens paraded through Lafayette Square hoisting up a 51-foot long inflatable balloon in the form of a joint. The rally ended with a brief march up 17th St., towing a loudspeaker playing an assortment of reggae and soft rock, while cheered on by a number of bystanding tourists and pedestrians.. . DCMJ founder Adam Eidinger did not apply for a protest permit, a Secret Service spokesman told the Washington Post. Likewise, many attendees, partaking in an act of civil disobedience, were prepared for possible arrest.. . “Smoke it anyways,” said Edward Forchion, a restaurant owner and activist known in the pot community as ‘NJ Weedman.’ Forchion chose to light up regardless. “I’ve always been about civil disobedience,” he said, “they’ll be forced to change the law.”. . Though there were ultimately no arrests, two protesters were detained by police outside the White House and fined $25 for public smoking. A fellow demonstrator gave them both money to cover the fine.. . While marijuana in DC was decriminalized by a ballot measure which took effect last summer, its possession and consumption is still punishable by hefty fines and jail time across much of the country. It is also still criminalized on federal property, such as at the White House.. . Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration, a designation which it shares with heroin, LSD, and ecstasy. Under Schedule 1, clinical research of cannabis is restricted and possession is federally illegal.. . “As long as cannabis is treated in the same category of drugs as heroin, with no accepted medical use, police will continue to arrest & lockup our brothers and sisters,” organizer DCMJ said on Facebook.. .

See the full article at: http://news2share.com/start/2016/03/31/florida-senate-candidate-augustus-invictus-on-liberty-fascism-drugs-and-paganism/. . Invictus made headlines in October when Florida Libertarian Party chairman Adrian Wyllie stepped down to protest his candidacy. Invictus is currently running unopposed for the nomination.. . “He is the absolute exact opposite of a Libertarian. He’s a self-proclaimed fascist. He’s promoting a second civil war,” Wyllie told the Associated Press.. . Invictus disagrees and says that the backlash from within the party is a result of his pagan religion and a one-time animal sacrifice he performed after a dangerous trek through the Mojave Desert. “I sacrificed a goat, and that was that,” he told News2Share’s Ford Fischer.. . Pointing to his campaign website, he contends that his platform is in line with libertarianism, “except maybe one or two issues like immigration and maybe abortion.” On the website, he calls himself “The most dangerous Libertarian in America.”. . Earlier this month, Invictus was denied entry into Canada for accusations that he may be a fascist. When asked where allegations of fascism come from, he explained that “I think that a lot of criticism of fascism comes to the aesthetic of the campaign. The eagle and the fasces. One person’s pointed out that I use oratory tone instead of a conversational tone in speeches.”. . As a third party, Invictus faces an uphill battle to gain money and support. He says that while he’s struggled to gain money, he’s received voter and media attention, sometimes unexpectedly.. . “The black metal scene for instance, 100% support, all across the board,” he explained. “Some biker groups, tattoo artists… The subculture nobody aims for politically because they are apolitical, those are the people supporting the campaign by and large.”. . His campaign tactics are certainly unconventional for a politician running in the United States. Following allegations that Republican Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz may have five mistresses, Mr. Invictus tweeted that “Seems there is a politician out there with more mistresses than me – and I’m a pagan polyamorist. I tip my hat to you, sir.”. . “Well I’d have to give no comment on how many mistresses I have, or their names of course,” he told News2Share. “My hat’s off to Ted Cruz. That’s amazing that he could do that and still profess to be an Evangelical Christian… I’ve never professed to be a Christian so that moral standard does not apply to me.”. . While he is open about polyamory and self-documented use of LSD, Mr. Invictus says these things should not be relevant to him as a candidate.. . “Everybody knows that every politician in this city has done drugs. Everybody knows that every politician in this city has a mistress,” he said, explaining that voters will appreciate honesty on these issues. “I think it would be a lot worse if I said, ‘I want to help Israel nuke all their surrounding countries,’ or ‘I want to implement a total welfare state and go full Communism.’ Those would be bad things for a politician to say.”. . As for the general election, he feels that he can bring Republicans on board, but as for people on the left “I’m not aiming for that demographic, I really don’t want their vote.”. . While he may only grab a portion of Republican votes and does not seek the support of Democratic voters, he is still aiming to win.. . “Even if I could do it all over, I wouldn’t change a thing.”. .

In the video, helicopter footage showing the Finicum shooting is used twice paired with the sounds of a helicopter interior and gunshots. The FBI has not released audio from the incident, so that audio is likely fake.. . The video was sent along with a transcript, but no further information:. . "The FBI claim they want peace in Oregon but they have created the opposite.. . Ammon Bundy, LaVoy Finicum, and the others only wanted peace. They even met with the FBI face to face.. . And yet Finicum was killed in cold blood, as his hands were in the air. Just as Anonymous called for justice in the killing of Michael Brown we call for justice now.. . The FBI has the weapons but they do not have the heart. It is time for Anonymous to engage.. . We do not call for violence, or armed uprising. We call for Anonymous members to spread this fight online. Every citizen of the United States must hear our call. We want the identity of every agent who fired their weapon that day. We want justice for LaVoy. We stand with Ammon Bundy.. . This fight is not over. As patriots sit in jail and await trial Anonymous will give them our full support.. .

Activists gathered at the Justice Center Complex early Tuesday afternoon, and marched through rush hour shutting intersections near Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena and Progressive Field. . . The protest remained peaceful throughout, despite a brief flare in tensions as demonstrators met a police blockade near Cleveland’s Shoreway early in the march. Protesters later surrounded police vehicles in front of the Quicken Loans Arena, prompting police to bring in reinforcements wearing riot gear. There were no arrests, a police spokesman said.. . Chants ranged from “the whole damn system is guilty as hell,” and “we are Tamir,” to intermittent shouts of “racist” and “pig” directed toward police. Marchers, at one point, blocked a police vehicle as a man held a photo of Rice to the windshield, chanting “unacceptable.”. . The Tamir Rice decision marks the latest in a series of high-profile cases ending with no charges over officer-involved shootings. Similar cases in Baltimore, New York City, and Ferguson have led to accusations of the legal system being biased in favor of police. Said one demonstrator, “I mean, it just reinforced a certain idea and a certain understanding that the system is not working in the interest of a certain demographic” adding “it just reinforced that we are powerless.”. . Local and national activists continue to plan actions in response to the Rice ruling. The NAACP has called for civil disobedience in Cleveland and unveiled a list of demands including a release of sealed jury transcripts and the dismissal of Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty. . . McGinty, speaking to press after the decision, said video shown to the jury served as “indisputable” evidence that Tamir was drawing a pellet gun from his waistband. McGinty said there was was no way police could have differentiated an imitation gun from a real weapon, and that Rice’s death resulted from a “perfect storm of human error, mistakes and miscommunications.”. . A second protest is planned at the Justice Center on Dec. 30, activists said.. . Produced by Trey Yingst. Video Edited by Ford Fischer. Article by Alejandro Alvarez. .

Like its historic predecessor, Saturday’s event, billed as “Justice or Else,” sought to address grievances by African-Americans and other minority groups perceived as marginalized in American society. The event was organized largely by religious group Nation of Islam (NOI), which also helped organize the original event which attracted an estimated 837,000 to the National Mall on October 16, 1995.. . “We want equal justice under the law,” reads a vision statement on the event’s website. “We want justice applied equally regardless to creed or class or color.”. . Among those who addressed Justice or Else attendees were District Mayor Muriel Bowser and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who praised the Black Lives Matter movement and urged youth present to carry on the spirit of the 20th anniversary event.. . "What good are we if we don't prepare young people to carry the torch of liberation to the next step,” said Farrakhan.. . Also present at the rally was political scientist and author Dr. Umar Johnson, who told News2Share that rights and conditions for blacks in America have overall deteriorated in the 20 years since the original march. . .

In a park on the outskirts of Baltimore, a group of spectators gathered to cheer on friends, parents and significant others. Fans kneeled along the sides of a grassy field, while a few people lounged in fold-out chairs perched under trees.. . The scene was set for any soccer, lacrosse or baseball game. But instead of shortstops and center-fielders, they cheered for wizards and warlords.. . Darkon fighters prepare for battle at Oregon Park.. . It’s called Live-Action Role Playing, or LARPing, where players dress up as fantasy characters and fight one another with foam weapons.. . Movies like “Role Models” and “Knights of Badassdom” have caused LARPing to gain more notoriety, but because of the mainstream portrayal of role-playing games, the title of “LARPer” usually comes with a stigma.. . “I think in a satirical way they touch on what this is, but you’re not going to get accuracy out of a  raunchy comedy,” Gerard McNeal, longtime LARPer, said of movies like “Role Models.”. . McNeal, 43, is the former president of Darkon Wargaming, one of the largest LARPing clubs in the country.. . In LARP, players battle one another using fake foam swords and other hand-made weapons. They are also encouraged to create a character, whose persona a LARPer adopts while they play. Characters have elaborate background stories that include alternate skills, family lives, religions and relationships.. . Players are often accused of using the game as an unhealthy escape from their real lives, but most participants hold steady jobs and have social lives outside of the game, McNeal said.. . “People view it as an escapist thing, that it’s not just a fun activity you can do like a videogame,” he said.. . Twice a month, Darkon attracts a crowd of a hundred or more to park grounds throughout the Maryland area. It’s not only the most consistently attended LARP clubs, it’s also one of the most inclusive, according to Alynna Lunaris, aka “Foxglove.”. . Lunaris, 45, finalized her transition to become a woman nearly 15 years ago, and since then has never found a more welcoming community, she said.. . “I have not seen this type of acceptance in almost any other community, so I do think it’s quite unique,” she said.. . Lunaris even got married surrounded by her Darkon friends. In May, Lunaris tied the knot with Christina, aka “Bunny,” her partner of nearly four years.. . In Darkon, there are no stigmas, she said.. . “It’s actually really nice to say and very unusual to say, that there is no transgender community [in Darkon]”,” Alynna Lunaris said. “There is no difference. In the group I’m one of the people, one of the girls.”. . And although the character names and weapons are fake, LARPing had some real life lessons to pass on to its players, according to Ianje Castellanos and Sev Gedra, two Darkon fighters.. . Castellanos, aka “Fyxe,” was a shy bookworm before she started LARPing at Darkon, she said.. . Fyxe uses red contact lenses to give her character a unique twist. . . “It just gave me something that I could excel at for the first time in my life,” she said. “I was one of those closeted nerd kids, always behind like a computer, reading a book kind of thing.”. . But LARPing, and Darkon specifically, made her learn to make her voice heard, she said. Gedra, who goes by just “Sev” in the game, agreed.. . “Some people have louder voices than others, so if you want your voice heard, making it heard is important,” Gedra said. That lesson has helped her not only with wargaming, but also in the business world, where she is a costume maker, special-effects makeup artist and welder, she said.. . For Gedra and Castellanos, Darkon is a place where their imaginations and strong personalities can thrive. And dressing up in costumes gives LARPing the extra bit of “flair” they like.. . “Why the fuck not?” Castellanos said. “It’s what I want to be.”. . Produced by Jacquie Lee. Filmed by Ford Fischer.

Giggling and drunk, two college students request a ride to their dorm building. Long hours and late nights-that’s what Paul Peterson, 38, has grown accustomed to since starting his job as an Uber driver last year. But it’s better than sitting in a jail cell, which is what he did for seven years before his release in 2013.. . Peterson is one of millions of Americans with a criminal record. According to the U.S Department of Justice, 2.3 million Americans are currently behind bars.. . Re-entering society after prison comes with a myriad of challenges­. Ongoing legal battles and finding housing and work are among the most reported difficulties convicts face.. . Peterson is one of the many ex-cons who struggled to find a job after prison.. . “It was very difficult to find a job when I came home because I’m a convicted felon and a lot of people do background checks,” Peterson said.. . Lately, politicians and mainstream entertainment put a spotlight on prison reform, which has contributed to a larger discussion of America’s justice system.. . President Barack Obama visited a federal Oklahoma prison last month and discussed sentencing laws, rehabilitation programs and what can be done to create a smoother re-entry process.. . “My hope is that if we can keep on looking at the evidence, keep on looking at the facts, figure out what works, that we can start making a change,” Obama said.. . The popular Netflix television show,“Orange is the New Black,” is based on a memoir detailing one woman’s year-long stint in prison. The series became a spotlight for activism after Piper Kerman, author of the memoir, spoke out against job discrimination against ex-cons in an interview earlier this summer.. . Time behind bars for conspiracy to distribute narcotics left Peterson, like Kerman, reeling to find steady work when he re-entered society, he said.. . Uber gave him the second chance he needed.. . “I feel like Uber gave me the chance to provide for my family right now,” Peterson said.. . For seven years, Peterson bounced around federal prisons all over the country. He spent time in the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Fairton, N.J., the FCI in Ashland, Ky. and was released from the FCI in Cumberland, Md. in 2013.. . Peterson spent the past year driving for Uber and rubbing elbows with the dregs and elite of the District. The time he spent dealing drugs served as practice, he said.. . “[With] my background, I think I’m able to socialize and, like, basically deal with all walks of society,” he said. “The things that I did, as far as the drug selling, I sold drugs to the lowest forms to, there’s been times when I’m pretty sure the people I was selling drugs to could have been in the Senate or Congress.”. . Peterson hopes to open a halfway house for ex-cons and publish a book.  As far as advice, Peterson urged ex-cons to work the rehabilitation system in prison the best they can and create a plan.. . “If you don’t have a support system it’s gonna be hard for you,” he said.   “You need to come out here and do what you gotta do man, because eventually, you’re gonna be a grown old man dyin’ in prison.”. .

News2Share contributor Alex Poucher captured this scene in the German city of Guben, where protesters peacefully assembled to criticize Germany's asylum policies.. . "They are condemning German asylum politics saying most refugees who come in to Germany take advantage of the tax payer and only those who come from war zones need the help all others need to be sent home immediately," Poucher says. "They say that they are destroying the German culture and homeland.". . Poucher further explained the protesters' position: "They want the money spent on more German issues like health and education and pensions. They claim that young men from Africa are criminals and that the refugee from the Balkans are only here for economical reason therefor have no right to apply for asylum. They want the asylum house that they were protesting at gone. In general they condemn any male refugees saying they should rather fight for their countries instead of fleeing it and that only women and children should be granted asylum.". .

In a first-of-its-kind ‘nationwide houseparty’, followers of Sanders hosted events at over 3,500 locations, including houses and bars, to gather momentum for his Democratic primary race.. . At a get-together in Washington, D.C., News2Share’s Trey Yingst sat down for a drink with young Sanders supporters to find out why they support his bid for the White House.. . Jojo Drake, a rising junior at the UNC-Chapel Hill, said she hoped the effort would inspire others of her age to come out and vote for Bernie next year. . . “If you look at the past midterm election, the number of young people who voted was pretty abysmal, Drake said. “I think it’s really important that we get them engaged and get them to care.”. . Midway through the event, all attention turned to televisions around the bar as Sanders prepared to address his supporters across the nation. . . Sanders spoke about the need to prioritize affordable education, single payer health care, and sustainable environmental practices. He frequently punctuated his points with his catchphrase of “enough is enough” and said he attributed his meteoric rise in popularity to an unsustainable trend of wealth inequality and institutional racism.. . Following the live speech, many people in the crowd stressed the event’s importance.. .  “We are all part of a historic moment,” stated one, “our job is to turn this into a historic movement.” . . While fellow Democratic contender Hillary Clinton continues to lead by double digits in the latest polls, Sanders continues to draw thousands of enthusiastic supporters to campaign events.. .

The activists hope to send a message to President Obama that he must act after hearing of mass killings of Syrian civilians by the Assad regime.. . “The media doesn’t talk much about it,” Mustaphi Saffou, a Syrian rights activist, said. “If it doesn’t affect U.S citizens no one knows about it.”. . The protest,“Stand with Caesar,” occurred the same day Caesar’s photographs – documenting mass killings of more than 11,000 people by security forces in Syria during the civil uprising from 2011-2013 – were displayed in the Halls of Congress.. . Dressed in blue jackets, demonstrators stood in support of the victims in the photographs and their families. Caesar himself donned a blue hooded jacket as well as a pseudonym in order to protect his identity when he first spoke in front of the U.S House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2014.. . Caesar smuggled out more than 55,000 high-resolution images of the conditions inside Syrian prisons before he fled Syria in 2013. The graphic images show beaten and tortured bodies of Syrian prisoners.  Assad opposition groups posted more than 6,000 images online, prompting families to search for their family members throughout the photos.. . For demonstrator Hashem Mubarak, the photos were a reminder of the innocent victims of Assad’s brutal regime, and when he first saw them he was overcome with sadness, he said.. . “I was crying, because this could be my uncle, my cousin,” he said. “This is a human being who did nothing but stand up for freedom. He was a husband to somebody, a father to somebody.”. . Many demonstrators compared the killings by Assad’s regime to the Holocaust.. . “We are going to wake up one day and think this is the second Holocaust, and we didn’t do anything about it,” Samar Hamwi said.. . Activists hope Obama will create a safe zone in Syria in order to protect civilians, activist Erica Hanichak said. Although the United States is primarily concerned with ISIS, the two issues are not far apart, Hanichak said. Removing Assad would not only protect Syrian civilians, it would help push ISIS out of the region as well, she added.. . “By addressing Assad you can address ISIS,” Hanichak said.. .

Shadow Senator Says Trump "is a Racist"</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 9, 2015</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Local officials and activists gathered in Washington, D.C. on Thursday to protest against Donald Trump at the site of the new Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue.. . Today’s demonstration came amid outcry over Trump’s statements on immigrants during his campaign announcement speech, where he said many Mexican immigrants “are bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”. . In attendance was D.C. Shadow Senator Michael D. Brown, who strongly opposed Trump’s comments and denounced his presidential run. “We’re here to dump Mr. Trump,” Brown told the crowd. “He’s not fit to do business in this city, and he’s not fit to run for president of the United States.”. . Brown noted that other people and corporations have already “dumped” Trump, including Macy’s, NBC, ESPN, and Univision, and urged more to follow. Speaking to News2Share, Brown accused Trump of racism, pointing out his challenging the authenticity of President Obama’s birth certificate.. . “This man is a racist. We don’t want him in our city,” he explained.. Also in attendance were numerous Latino political advocacy and pro-immigration groups, including Latino Victory, CASA, and the Latino Caucus.. . While around 150 people attended the protest in front of Trump’s new hotel, a comparatively smaller counter-demonstration across the street voiced support for Trump. According to one Trump advocate present, “Trump’s going to create jobs.”. . Produced by Trey Yingst. Filmed by Dominick Mortarotti. Photos by Alejandro Alvarez. Article by Ford Fischer.

His holiday weekend plan: deliver a ‘second Declaration of Independence’ and a bag of dirt from Southern states to the White House..  . “I know people try to label me a domestic terrorist or some nonsense like that,” he would later tell a Secret Service official, “but I’m the farthest from it.”.  . Kent, a commissioned Houston security officer and member of the militia group Oath Keepers, drove all the way from Houston intending to organize a march to the White House. His mission, he said, was to hold the Obama administration accountable for ‘treason against the American people.’.  . Joining him was Sean Bosilovick, General of Special Operations for the United States Militia, who said he was sent to ensure Kent accomplished his goal..  . As crowds gathered around the Washington Monument for the Fourth of July fireworks, Kent and Bosilovick sought to secure as many signatures on their Declaration as they could. They only managed to obtain about 20 signatures, far below their goal of 100. Still, they pressed on with delivery..  . Kent’s own “Declaration of Independence” is a self-professed rewording of the original, for example substituting “British crown” with “government crown,” and plugging in extremist groups such as the ‘Islamic State’ in the place of 18th century British mercenaries..  . Accompanying his declaration was a small bag of dirt and grass Kent gathered from each Southern state he crossed on his way to the capital. According to Kent, it was a gift meant to symbolize President Obama’s disregard of the South. “Obviously, [Obama] has not visited all the Southern states,” Kent said, “So let me bring him a little of them.”.  . The pair had planned to meet a larger group of activists in Washington, but their plans were hampered by a downpour and a communications breakdown on the afternoon of the delivery. .  . Kent and Bosilovick arrived at the White House that evening. They worked their way through the spectators gathering for the fireworks display, and presented their declaration to a US Park Police officer – who, it turns out, knew Kent by name..  . The pair was shortly after met by a group of Secret Service who, much to the amusement of onlookers, pulled them aside and searched them for weapons. As the fireworks began to boom behind the White House, Kent explained his delivery to a Secret Service officer, who promised to pass his declaration, including the bag of dirt, through the proper channels..  . Neither man was surprised by their encounter with the Secret Service. “We freaked out a lot of people,” Bosilovick said, “Which we should (…) American people are over the bullshit.”.  . After making the delivery, Kent and Bosilovick walked away confident they had completed their mission. “It was a definite success,” said Kent, “[The Secret Service] was more worried about militia and patriots than not, they knew it was me and the militia coming.”.  . Kent believes his activism is worth having law enforcement on his tail. “I’m pretty sure I’m going to be on the radar for a long, long time to come,” he said, to which Bosilovick was quick to add, “That’s what you do for America. We came here, we said what we were going to do, and we did it.”.  . Bosilovick, disappointed at the day’s low turnout despite the thousands of followers both men have online, said he hoped their action would inspire others to take up action against the government..  . His final message to fellow militiamen: “You guys want to keep typing on your keyboards? I’m standing right here in Washington, DC, baby.”. .

The march, led by the Association of Haitian Professionals and attended by Maryland State Senator Victor R. Ramirez and IMG_6696Haitian presidential candidate Charles Henri Baker, began at Dupont Circle and ended in front of the Embassy of the Dominican Republic. For an hour on Monday evening, busy Massachusetts Avenue was filled with cries of “Human rights know no borders,” and “Misma isla, misma raza” – Spanish for “Same island, same race.”. . The outcry comes as Dominican authorities appear ready to begin mass deportations of Haitians at virtually any moment. The dilemma facing Dominican Haitians today stems from a 2013 law making people born to undocumented foreigners after 1929 ineligible for Dominican nationality – effectively rendering the country’s more than 200,000 people of Haitian descent stateless.. . In May 2014, the Dominican government sought to pave the way for Haitian descendants to reapply for Dominican nationality if they wished to legally remain in the country. The deadline for that application passed on June 17, with an overwhelming majority of the country’s stateless Haitians unable to sign up and now facing possible deportation.. . The looming exodus has led immigration activists and international groups to accuse the Dominican government of human rights violations, and even racism. During today’s march, some demonstrators waved signs with messages including “Stop racist deportation,” and “Not 1 more racist deportation from DR,” and stood at the steps of the Dominican Republic’s embassy near Dupont Circle calling on Santo Domingo to reconsider its current policies.. . Charles Baker, Haitian presidential candidate, said he believed the Dominican government’s stance towards Haitian immigration to be “illegal, immoral, and unconstitutional.” Maryland State Senator Victor Ramirez called for a tougher response against the Dominican government.. . “I think it’s an atrocity, a disaster. I think the Dominican government needs to be held accountable,” Ramirez said, “I think we here in the United States need to bring some attention to what’s going on.”. . To close, protest leaders asked those gathered to spread the word about human rights and governments which seek to violate them.

Picketing in front of the Smithsonian Castle, where the board was meeting, the protesters chanted "Kick Koch off the board!”. . Lise Van Susteren, co-founder of the Interfaith Action on Climate Change, is on the advisory board of the Natural History Museum and believes that this cause deserves more attention.. . "We are in a crisis state," Van Susteren said referring to global warming. “We need action now, and we need those profiting from other people’s misery to get out of the way.”. . The activists delivered a petition with over 430,000 signatories to the board, declaring that "it is time to get climate deniers out of museums.” . . Afterwards, the protestors marched around to the Museum of Natural History where several speakers engaged the crowd and described climate change as a moral issue.. . David Koch, the focus of the protest, is the fourth richest American and famous for championing conservative causes. According to Greenpeace, Koch denies human caused climate change as a need for concern. As a board member, he funded the Hall of Human origins in the Museum of Natural History, which activists say depicts climate change as a natural phenomenon with human benefits.. .

Led by CODEPINK Co-founder Medea Benjamin, they attempted to deliver a petition demanding the release of liberal blogger Raif Badawi. . . Benjamin demands the immediate release of Badawi. “[the government] must respect free speech," Benjamin told News2Share. "I think if there was one phone call from President Obama that said, 'free Raif Badawi,' Raif would be free.". . Upon entering the embassy, the protesters were forcefully removed. The protesters continued to picket outside the embassy chanting, “no flogging for blogging” and “journalism is not a crime.” The group continued to protest for about an hour before dispersing.. . In June 2012, Badawi was arrested by Saudi Arabian authorities for apostasy, which is defined as the renunciation of a religious belief, and insulting Islam through electronic channels. . . After several trials, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, 1,000 lashes and a fine of $1,000,000 Riyal ($267,000 USD). After his first set of lashings, Badawi’s case received attention and widespread protest from the international community, who derided the lashes as state sanctioned torture.. . Michael Beer, from Nonviolence International, criticized the Saudi government.  “Unfortunately, this is the tip of the iceberg in Saudi Arabia," Beer said. "It is a massive repressive state that restricts free speech.". . The public outcry combined with Badawi’s declining health caused the remainder of the lashes to be postponed. With a recent decision upholding the sentencing by the Saudi Supreme Court, activists are worried.  International efforts have continued to grant Badawi amnesty.. .

News2Share contributor Alex Poucher was on the scene in Germany where 22,000 police officers were deployed to control the riots. Poucher had this to say about the protester’s motivation, and the escalation in violence:.  “[The protesters] do not like how seven world leaders are coming together for closed door discussions without the public being able to listen in. The demonstration today was registered and remained peaceful until they got to a point where the police blocked the protesters and told them they were not allowed to continue marching. The registered protest agreement stated that the protesters were going to be able to march 200 meters past the point where they were stopped. After the police stopped, violence escalated as protesters attempted to continue marching by force. Officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray, smoke bombs and even fire extinguishers.”.  Poucher says he will continue to remain on the scene of the clashes over the coming days, where he says he does not expect the conflict to end easily.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 88.148146%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41p9dv-jPog" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41p9dv-jPog/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Man Missing After Being Swept Away in Potomac River</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 3, 2015</p><p class="youtube-video-description">On Wednesday afternoon a man was swept away in the Potomac river after jumping off of a nearby cliff.

Washington Convention Center in Northwest DC. The protestors were arrested while blocking the entrance to the center where the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is holding its annual policy conference.. . About 150 people attended the rally organized by CODEPINK–a women-led NGO that organizes anti-war protests across the country. Coined #ShutDownAIPAC, the rally's purpose was to draw attention to AIPAC’s role as a pro-Israel lobby in US policies, and Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the US as a guest speaker for both AIPAC, and a joint session at Congress taking place tomorrow.. . "Its important to challenge AIPAC's influence in Washington DC, and to show our strength in numbers today," says Alli McCracken, CODEPINK'S National Organizer. CODEPINK and other pro-Palestine organizations are urging the US government to advocate for diplomacy with Iran and condemn Israel's siege of the Gaza Strip.. . Madea Benjamin, CODEPINK''s Founder, believes that Diplomacy with Iran is key to keeping peace in the region.. . "If you look at where we stand as a nation right now, and with all the violence that’s happening in the middle east, it’s a very scary time" Benjamin says. "If these negotiations with Iran don't come to fruition, that could mean a war with Iran. Unfortunately, AIPAC is adding fuel to the fire.". . Some have criticized the Pro-Palestine movement as anti-Semetic. McCracken says this is not the case. "Criticizing the government policies of another country isn't the same as criticizing an ethnicity or a religion" McCracken satates. "You cannot conflate anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism." More demonstrations will take place throughout the week, including another rally during Netanyahu’s appearance at AIPAC on Monday, and a march to House Speaker, John Boehner's house on Tuesday.. .

A rally for the transgender teen, who committed suicide on Dec 28th, was held in Washington D.C. on Saturday, Jan 10th.. The protest was orchestrated by a group of trans individuals and advocates who created the rally to raise awareness for health and policy concerns that transgender people face. . Protesters gathered at the “Justice for Leelah Alcorn Rally and March” to hear speakers and show support for the late Alcorn who took her own life, because she felt she received little support from her community. . The organizer of the rally, Jes Grobman, is organizer for DC Trans Power which focuses on empowering and supporting change within trans communities. . The protest marched from Mt. Vernon Square to the Department of Justice to read a list of demands. . Lourdes Ashley Hunter, the National Director for Trans Women of Color Collective, spoke of acceptance, justice and change.. “Oppression manifests in every aspect of our lives, but the way structural oppression  is set up will have you to believe that we need to be fixed. And I’m here to tell you, we don’t need to be fixed there is nothing wrong with us. What is wrong is society’s depraved existence, willful ignorance, complicity, and inactive engagement which refuse trans people humanity and right to life.“. Leelah Alcorn was a transgender girl who walked in front of a truck at 2:30 A.M. on Dec 28th, 2014. She left a suicide note, blaming her parents for her upbringing and depression, and pleading to “fix society.” . “When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.” she said in the note, which was scheduled to post on her Tumblr blog after her death.. Alcorn said that she felt like she “was a girl trapped in a boys body,” and apparently had felt that way since she was four years old. . Leelah’s story resonated over social media, as well as in many LGBTQ communities. The hashtag #RestInPower and #LeehlahAlcorn are being used to posthumously support Alcorn.. Much of the protest focused on creating validity and recognition for the rights that trans people are currently fighting for.. . Produced by Ford Fischer and Trey Yingst. .

Topics ranged from politics to war, but race police brutality took the forefront. While many were part of the Black Lives Matter movement, some, such as Dennis Jackson, tried to advocate on behalf of the police and claimed that not following an officer's orders would be "suicide by cop.". Others felt that his position may have been well-intended but misplaced. One protester in particular felt that this sort of rhetoric blames the victim..

On display for the whole world  to see. The Klan is to be feared, not threatened.". . While the outcome of this feud is yet to be determined, Anonymous has claimed through this new video that "[The KKK's] violent ideology will not prevail in this fight.". . CNN has reported that a decision regarding the indictment of Officer Darren Wilson could occur Friday, with an announcement Sunday. At that point, it is quite possible that the feelings expressed via videos like these and social media will be expressed on the streets of Ferguson from all sides.. .

To honor the occasion, groups took to Wenceslas Square dressed in masks and costumes before parading down Narodni.  While the parade commemorated the end of communism in the Czech Republic, this year’s anniversary also bore tones of discontent with the current government, most notably its leader, president Milos Zeman.. The demonstrations varied from a pro-Ukraine group featuring a massive bear puppet with the face of Vladimir Putin to a group of solemn masked figures handing out post cards with anecdotes of political prisoners before the Revolution. The largest group was comprised of protesters passing out red cards and waving them in the air. These symbolized a “red card” for the President, a call for him to step down from power. This sentiment has grown recently in light of the President’s pro-Russian position on the Ukraine conflict and praise of Chinese policies. . The day concluded with a chain of candles lit along Narodni in memory of the Revolution’s first student protestors, some of whom were brutally beaten when the side streets of Narodni were blocked off, leaving no escape. Live music performances inside parked trams, a chalk board reminiscent of the Lennon wall and tents filled with anti-communist literature lined Narodni as the candles shone on through the misty Prague night.. .

Thinking she was home, the dog began scratching at a neighbor’s door to get inside. When the neighbor called the police, officers arrived, killed her, and left her body on a hill near the road without notifying the family.. . Ford Fischer and Trey Yingst of News2share visited Glen Rock Pennsylvania, where they visited the gravesite as well as where Lucy was shot. Bryan Hartman, who was working at a firearms factory at the time of the shooting, expressed his frustrations not only with the details of the shooting, but the traumatic aftermath. His wife, Shelly Hartman, was also deeply impacted, and miscarried her pregnancy three weeks after the shooting.. . After visiting the gravesite, Fischer and Yingst traveled with the Hartmans to the Pennsylvania State House in Harrisburg, the site of one of 50 nationwide “Freeze: Don’t shoot” rallies to protest police violence against dogs. Bryan told the crowd his story of what police did to Lucy and the aftermath. Other protestors joined him in telling stories, mourning, and demanding change.. . While tragic, Lucy’s shooting is not unique. One dog, Ivy, was shot in the jaw by police only a month ago and is currently active but recovering. According to her owner, Mark Soltis, "the dog's never been aggressive to nobody... There was really no reason for the officer to shoot his weapon in the middle of the afternoon around children." . . Despite being called "aggressive" by the officer who shot her, Ivy played gently with children as the interview went on. . . Both Ivy and the late Lucy were part Pitbull. Khaldun Rasheed, a former worker at the Humane Society, noted that stereotypes and poor police training may be responsible for how frequently they are killed by police. "I think that the myth that all of them are evil is wrong," he said. "I would be against arbitrary violent acts, randomly shooting dogs.". . Donna Earley, the event’s organizer, encouraged the crowd to call their state representatives to pass laws mandating training for police officers to minimize fatalities of family pets in the future.. . "It's not always wise to go for the gun first," she said. "There's other means of deterrence other than putting a bullet in our dogs.". .

Specifically, he remarks that there is significant evidence of Russians who have left Russia and could come back to commit acts of terror there. He uses the opportunity as well to observe that The United States and Russia still disagree over some issues such as Ukraine. However, he remarks that their mutual interest in stopping ISIS and their joint efforts at the international space station show the ability of the countries to work together when needed.. . Jon-Christopher Bua told News2share afterwards: "It has been reported that the Russians made an overture to the Iraqis that they would be supportive in defeating ISIL. Perhaps a good opportunity for President Obama to reach out to President Putin to join the Coalition in this effort. As the coalition grows internationally this might be a way to bridge the growing divide between the US, Europe and Russia-  A win win for all. It is clear that both the US and Russia share this common interest. Josh Earnest did not rule out that possibility, and in fact noted that the US and Russia continue to have a good working relationship in regards to international security.".

Estimates had it that between 10,000 and 30,000 people participated, and this video certainly lends legitimacy to that claim.. . Sarah told me: "I attended this protest as a part of GMU Students Against Israeli Apartheid, and the collective DMV SJP, in order to condemn the egregious crimes and human rights violations committed by Israel towards the Palestinian people in alarming disproportionality. As a member of GMU SAIA, as an Egyptian-American, I choose to stand on the side of justice with the oppressed (Palestinians), and against the oppressors and implementors of apartheid (Israel). This is a matter of fact and morality, where there is a clear line between who is doing the oppressing and who is the oppressed. This rally serves to bring attention to this issue and to call for support and solidarity for Palestine, as well as an end to the atrocious apartheid policies and crimes of Israel. Also might I add that not only did I see Palestinian flags, but also a plethora of Free Syrian Flags, Iraqi Flags, Turkish Flags and Egyptian Flags. This shows the vast nuances of diverse solidarity for Palestine.

Lamport told me: "I would say that this is definitely not the vacation I was anticipating. Everyone in Israel, especially in the south, is basically confined to their homes lately because there have been thousands of rockets falling as well as terrorists coming in through underground tunnels. Business has definitely gone down for most places that don't offer necessary services here because people try to stay near bomb shelters as often as possible. At first I was okay but after the failed ceasefires it's gotten more scary, like the other day I had to stop on the side the road and huddle next to my car and watch the rockets hit nearby. Despite all this I have to say I know I'm very lucky because Israel has made it the law that every building must have a bomb shelter and we also have the Iron Dome to protect us. The innocent people of Gaza aren't as lucky however, I try to remind myself every time I run to a bomb shelter that at least my government is working to protect me and not putting me in the line of fire like Hamas does to Palestinians. I know some people might not think it's true but most Israelis I speak to feel essentially the same way, we realize how lucky we are to be so protected and we worry about what is happening to the innocent people who are stuck living under Hamas. As you know we just initiated our ground operation tonight, the purpose of it is to eliminate the terror tunnels which we can't do from the air. The ground operation has worsened the morale here as everyone has at least a relative or friend or two who now has to go into Gaza, so the whole country is basically biting their nails and hoping it's all over quickly!"</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 73.333334%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpeK4iI5BoM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PpeK4iI5BoM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Leading Anti-Zionist Rabbi Speaks Against Israeli State</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 17, 2014</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, an anti-zionist Rabbi speaks to News2share at the 7/16 Palestinian demonstration at the White House.

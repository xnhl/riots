Cops said once they found out the car was not stolen, they "immediately unhandcuffed everyone involved, explained what happened and apologized.". . Gilliam told KUSA this was not the first time there was confusion over the vehicle being reported stolen.. .

A diver attached a winch to the base of the bronze figure of the controversial slave trader which was hauled onto a wooden jetty shortly before 6am.. . Colston’s statue was damaged during the raucous BLM protest on Sunday and water could be seen pouring from a gaping hole in the side as contractors hauled it from the water.. . It was fished out at about 5am because the council "didn't want anybody to get hurt if there was a crowd there or anyone looking".. . "We've had a diver down there who attached the ropes to crane it out of the water and take it away," Ray Barnett, head of collections and archives at Bristol City Council, said.. . "The ropes that were tied around him, the spray paint added to him, is still there so we'll keep him like that.". . Mr Barnett said the statue would now be hosed down to remove the mud and ensure "we preserve him as he was tipped into the dock, while the decision is made how to move on for there".. . "Our intention is to stabilise him before he corrodes further," he said.. . Red and blue spray paint could be seen on its face and feet while rope used to pull it from its plinth was still tied around the statue.. . The figure - which has been in the city centre since 1895 - was missing it’s walking stick and was covered in scuff marks where protesters had rolled it to the harbourside.. . It took a team of five, including one diver in the water and another waiting on the shore, just under an hour to remove the statue that weighs just under a ton.. . The team had planned to use airbags to lift the sculpture to the surface, but instead relied upon a winch from a truck on the harbourside.. . The statue was transported to the city’s M-Shed museum where will exhibited alongside placards from the Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday.. .

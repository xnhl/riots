The attempt on Friday was thwarted. The hackers remotely gained access to a software program, named TeamViewer, on the computer of an employee at the facility for the town of Oldsmar to gain control of other systems, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in an interview.. . “The guy was sitting there monitoring the computer as he’s supposed to and all of a sudden he sees a window pop up that the computer has been accessed,” Gualtieri said. “The next thing you know someone is dragging the mouse and clicking around and opening programs and manipulating the system.”. . The hackers then increased the amount of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, being distributed into the water supply. The chemical is typically used in small amounts to control the acidity of water, but at higher levels is dangerous to consume.. . The plant employee alerted his employer, who called the sheriff. The water treatment facility was able to quickly reverse the command, leading to minimal impact.. . https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-florida-idUSKBN2A82FV</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 100%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqAK2GVtqDM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MqAK2GVtqDM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Prt.4 Riding with Antifa Behind The Line</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Feb 8, 2021</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Female reporter, Melissa “Claudio” Lewis, gets maced while seeing what it's like behind an Antifa front line in Portland.. @PhrenologyPhun.

She can be heard making false and baseless claims as she asks him a series of questions related to gun rights and how he was able to meet with senators. Hogg continues to walk without addressing Greene.. "He's a coward," Greene says at the end of the video as Hogg walks away, claiming his activism was funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is often the subject of far-right conspiracy theories, and other liberals. "He can't say one word because he can't defend his stance.". Greene -- who has previously called Hogg "# littleHitler" -- said in a written statement to CNN that the video was taken while she was in Washington, "going from office to office in the Senate to oppose the radical gun control agenda that David Hogg was pushing.". "In 11th grade, one of my fellow student took our school hostage with a gun he brought to our 'gun-free' school," Greene said. "I understand that fear firsthand and I will always work to protect our gun rights so that Americans can defend themselves and others against bad people intent to harm or kill them.". CNN has reached out to Hogg for comment. He tweeted Wednesday morning, "It's so frustrating that we have people like @mtgreenee in Congress that would rather spread conspiracies about mass shootings than confront the reality people are dying everyday from gun violence.". "I just want to do the work and help end gun violence" he said.. He added, "People like @mtgreenee would like you to think we do this work because we see it as fun and we are 'paid off' by Soros. That is anything but true. We organize because we have to -- not because we want to.

As a result of the misinformation campaign, prosecutors said, at least 4,900 unique phone numbers texted the number in a futile effort to cast votes for Mrs. Clinton..

"Excuse me," Wheeler says, "apparently you don't know the rules." He says that two people can dine together if they are six feet apart.. . "You weren't six feet apart from Mr. Adams over there," the man replies.. . "Yeah, we were," interjects Adams.. . The audio is then interrupted with rustling noises, apparently because Adams is walking. The last thing the man says before Wheeler deploys pepper spray appears to be: "Thanks for ruining our city," although the last word is garbled.. . "You just pepper sprayed me," the man then says.. . "You are one foot away from me," Wheeler replies. "You are not six feet away.". . "Oh my god," says the man, seemingly reacting to the spray. "Wow.". . Adams suggests Wheeler leave. "All right, Mr. Mayor, get on the road.". . The man Wheeler sprayed also appears to be recording the altercation, because he narrates what happened to an audience. "You just pepper sprayed me, for no reason, at all," he says.. . "Actually," Adams replies, as Wheeler's car engine starts, "I was here, and you were like a foot from him. He asked you to back away, and you didn't.". . The man continues narrating. "I can't see," he says, "but the mayor has just thrown something at me.". . https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2021/01/25/sam-adams-recorded-audio-of-ted-wheeler-pepper-spraying-a-man-outside-mcmenamins-heres-the-tape/</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 100%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIePu9E-YvA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KIePu9E-YvA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Tommy Decentralized - Forest of Darkness</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jan 24, 2021</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Epiphone acoustic guitar.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 100%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBzMOx_vm58" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hBzMOx_vm58/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Rep.

The men, one of whom was wearing a "Make America Great Again" headband, called part of the monolith's construction "gay" then replaced it monolith with a wooden cross. It is a decidedly bleak turn in the ongoing monolith saga that has generally been a delightful distraction for a world wracked by a pandemic.“Christ is king in this country. We don’t want illegal aliens from Mexico or outer space,” a man in the video says. “So let’s tear this bitch down.”As the group of three struggle to topple the 200-pound statue, they can be heard chanting as they sway it back and forth. Eventually, the monolith’s base breaks and it falls to the ground. https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpjk7/mysterious-monolith-update-racists-destroy-california-monolith-proclaim-christs-superiority-to-space-aliens</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMeSVHpwWm0" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lMeSVHpwWm0/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump to Defund Military over Twitter</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Dec 3, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Trump wants to defund the military because he is upset over being called #DiaperDon.

Images from the scene showed the building was tagged with expletives directed at President-elect Joe Biden and the phrase “no presidents.”The event was promoted as being “in solidarity” with the racial justice protests that have erupted in recent months, but its target and slogans suggested a more squarely antigovernment stance, as well as left-wing dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party.Early Monday morning, police said the group quickly fled the scene of the vandalism, but three people were arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief.https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/11/protesters-shatter-windows-paint-graffiti-on-multnomah-county-democrats-building.html</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZe4FT_Wsu8" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZe4FT_Wsu8/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Matt Gaetz and Tiffany Trump</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 12, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Will make great pets.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOWYDgkZGn8" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mOWYDgkZGn8/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump Supporter Threatens Female</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 12, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Trump supporters are cracking. @davenewworld_2</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdGD6enzpZg" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OdGD6enzpZg/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Million MAGA March</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 10, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">And the unstoppable madness.#MillionMAGAMarch#StopTheSteal</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21hDprP0t5U" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/21hDprP0t5U/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Stop The Steal Gone Wild</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 10, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">When the music's over.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvukGH99Ew8" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CvukGH99Ew8/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Why Trump Supporters Are Not Rioting</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 10, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Truth be told.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxi4Ixcz8mQ" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nxi4Ixcz8mQ/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Demolition Hammer - Infectious Hospital Waste</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Nov 8, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Off the Tortured Existence album from 1990Demolition Hammer is a thrash metal band from the Bronx, New York.

Lee: The sense of grandiose omnipotence that he displays seems especially appealing to his emotionally-needy followers. No matter what the world says, he fights back against criticism, continues to lie in the face of truth, and above all is still president. What matters is that he is winning, not whether he is honest or law-abiding. This may seem puzzling to the rest of us, but when you are overcome with feelings of powerlessness, this type of cartoonish, exaggerated force is often more important than true ability. This is the more primitive morality, as we call it, of “might makes right,” which in normal development you grow out of by age five.𝘉𝘶𝘵, 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦, 𝘛𝘳𝘶𝘮𝘱 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘱𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵? 𝘞𝘩𝘺?Strongman-type personalities are very appealing in times of socioeconomic or political crisis, as the population is less able to think rationally but is rather overcome with fear, or desire to draw strength from fantastical ideas. This happens to normal people in times of stress, or to people whose development has been stunted because of emotional injury. The problem is, the person who promises the impossible and states, “I alone can fix it,” and gives himself an A+ on his performance, is not a strong person who can deliver but the opposite. So Mr. Trump’s “base“ looks for someone to rescue them and their intense yearning does not allow them to see through his deception, while Mr. Trump senses better than anyone their needs (they are his) and makes use of them for his own benefit—even as he disdains his supporters for being so gullible. In this manner, they fulfill each other’s emotional needs in a mutually unhealthy way.𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵’𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘣𝘪𝘨𝘨𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘯?One concern I have, in my 20 years of studying this personality structure while treating violent offenders, is the disturbing societal trend. More and more of this personality type are taking on leadership positions, including of corporations, whereas 20 years ago one would mostly find them in jails and prisons. This also means there are a growing number of people who emulate them in the general culture, who become deprived from the structures that they create, and who become emotionally traumatized as a result of any of these consequences. People who are wounded this way continue to seek omnipotent parental figures as adults, and the vicious circle continues. Unable to find outer satisfaction for their inner needs, some keep pursuing ever greater power until they reach the highest positions, but since this is the opposite of proper treatment, their conditions only grow worse while society suffers a trail of carnage. It is actually a tragedy that Mr. Trump cannot receive proper care, even as his disorder is on display for the world to see, but is rather surrounded by those who enable his illness and make use of his weaknesses to their own destructive ends.𝘖𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥, 𝘥𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘴𝘶𝘱𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘛𝘳𝘶𝘮𝘱 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵—𝘭𝘦𝘵’𝘴 𝘴𝘢𝘺 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘯𝘦𝘰-𝘕𝘢𝘻𝘪𝘴—𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘮𝘶𝘤𝘩 𝘪𝘯 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘰𝘯.

Mr. Trump’s behavioral pattern is not that of leaders at all but rather of obsequious followers, as we have seen Mr. Trump become in the presence of even more successful strongmen, such as Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-Un, or Rodrigo Duterte. We find in him a pattern of following exactly what his base is looking for—he has no intrinsic philosophy or ideology but is responding to an emotional need for adulation and approval, and so he will try anything that gets as many people on board as possible. He will also sense keenly those who will never go along with his pathological methods—that is, healthy people—and drop them instantly. That is why we see him desperately clinging to an ever narrower base with increasingly fringe ideas.He also has to scapegoat groups in order to distract from his billionaire cabinet, tax breaks for the rich, and trade wars that hurt his base the most, and so his demonizing of other helpless groups will only increase with time.There will likely be no limit to the violence he is capable of, since destroying the world would be nothing compared to the shame and humiliation he might suffer.https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/yale-psychiatrist-explains-devotion-trump-based-emotional-patterns-people-grow-age-five/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMGE9PsoVw" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eaMGE9PsoVw/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Shocking Blue - Love Buzz</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Oct 30, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"Love Buzz" is a song by Dutch rock band Shocking Blue.

At 74 years old and obese, Trump falls into the highest risk category for serious complications from the disease, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans and more than 1 million people worldwide.His infection with the disease could prove destabilizing in an already fraught political climate, and stock market futures tumbled on news of Trump's infection."Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!" Trump tweeted shortly before 1 a.m. Friday.Later, the first lady wrote on Twitter that she and her husband were "feeling good."Trump was last seen in public on Thursday afternoon, returning to the White House after a fundraising trip to New Jersey. He did not appear ill, though he did not speak to reporters as he walked into his residence.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7yY87zfAyI" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g7yY87zfAyI/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Melania Trump's Secret Tape Recordings</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Oct 1, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Recordings made by Melania Trump’s ex-friend reveal another side to a first lady who has carefully cultivated an image of compassion, elegance and mystery.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLItOdx9xgc" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mLItOdx9xgc/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Sen.

Others describe the group as a man’s drinking fraternity. There are chapters all over the world.The group’s president, Enrique Tarrio, is Cuban and claims the Proud Boys has members of all races.“The worst things, inaccurate things that you could call my organization is white supremacist,” he told KOIN 6 News.Dr. Blazak, who has spent his entire career studying hate groups, said the Proud Boys is not a classic white supremacist group.“It’s more of a nationalist group,” he said. “A nationalist group that utilizes some of the tools that white supremacists use like xenophobia, or oppositions to Islam, or oppositions to liberal values in America.”https://www.koin.com/news/politics/trumps-stand-back-stand-by-remarks-shine-spotlight-on-proud-boys/The Proud Boys is a far-right neo-fascist male-only organization that promotes and engages in political violence. It is based in the United States and has a presence in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The group was started as a joke in the far-right Taki's Magazine in 2016 by Vice Media co-founder and former commentator Gavin McInnes, taking its name from the song "Proud of Your Boy" from the Disney musical Aladdin. The Proud Boys emerged as part of the alt-right, but McInnes began distancing himself from the alt-right in early 2017, saying the alt-right's focus is race while his focus is what he defines as "Western values." This re-branding effort intensified after the Unite the Right rally. Since 2018, the group's leader is Enrique Tarrio.The group believes men—especially white men—and Western culture are under siege; their views have elements of the fear of a white minority theory. Officially, the group rejects white supremacy, although members have participated in multiple racist events and events centered around anti-left violence, with a former member organizing the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. The organization glorifies violence and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has called it an "alt-right fight club."In late November 2018, it was reported the FBI had classified the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiZMXPSNYRY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XiZMXPSNYRY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">BLM & Lesbian Separatism</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Separatist lesbianism is a type of feminist separatism specific to lesbians.

She had a scheduled protest at Yorba Linda’s public library in the parking lot. The Trumpers planned a counter protest, but did not stay on their side. Fights broke out. Police ordered everyone to leave. The Trumpers blocked her from leaving though. They surrounded her car and tried to open her door. She got scared for her life and sped out, when she should have slowly pushed the car through, and or called the police. https://www.dailywire.com/news/pro-blm-activist-allegedly-rams-car-into-trump-supporters-charged-with-attempted-murderI guess "they shouldn't have been blocking the road."

Where we spend our lives. Smiling as the days go by. Ride or die, we choose the flip side. Passing on by, life in the fast lie. We live together like flies. Just you and I. My how time flies. How many times have we travel this way? In search of old days where nothing changes while the city burns. They take turns for the best, turns for the rest. We still ride out here on the east side. Come take a spin, we'll let you in. No way out. Heads never full of doubt. We had it all when it was left out for cold. So young, so bold. What did we know, with our city in tow? We watered our minds down with sanity. Nothing left but our vanity. City burns. Take a turn. With nothing left to prove or earn. We learned from the best, east and west, with the rest. The rat race came in last place. We still ride out here in the east side.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShW_yOPXpQ" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ShW_yOPXpQ/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Police Smash Breonna Taylor Protest in Portland</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 24, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Oppress a minority group.

Immediately after, police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly.https://www.koin.com/news/protests/smoke-clears-and-protests-resume-in-portland/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLOP6rkTmDo" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lLOP6rkTmDo/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Amish Trump Rally</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Pepper Coyote - No cock Like horse cock</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-Ob2t8-Z4" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WC-Ob2t8-Z4/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">First Person on Nars</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">US Lands on Nars</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfpVxCiQMJA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yfpVxCiQMJA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Fox News Compares BLM to Ted Bundy</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Well alrighty then.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwYkLmcy6YY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BwYkLmcy6YY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Is Trump Building a Secret Weapon?</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">One which the world has never seen before?</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QzO9MKNY_s" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1QzO9MKNY_s/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Piers Morgan & The Magical Tea Cup</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Now you see it, now you don't.

The mother was headed with her daughter to get some fast food when they passed the supporters.The mother yelled something as they sat in a turn lane waiting to get into the restaurant. Logsdon "got upset" and shoved his flagpole through the open right-front passenger window, the report said.The mother's video shows him coming up to the car with his flagpole and shoving it in at least twice. The end of the flagpole hit the girl on her face and chest, the report said.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjN9_Dkzhrk" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CjN9_Dkzhrk/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Life Like Melania Trump Statue Unveiled Slovenia</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 18, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">A new bronze statue of first lady Melania Trump was unveiled in Slovenia this week, after a wooden version of the memorial was burned in July.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKW5H6swQOM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKW5H6swQOM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">The Yoni</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 18, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Music: Yubaba - Mais (Feat.

FTPENID, Okla. (KFOR) – An Oklahoma woman who refused to cooperate during a traffic stop sparked a high-speed chase and guns being drawn in a neighborhood.Twenty-eight-year-old Emily Owings was initially pulled over for not wearing her seatbelt. She also didn’t have a license or her insurance.The only form of indentification she had on her was her medical marijuana card. Body camera footage shows what happened next:“Your license is suspended,” the officer said.“Why?” Owings asked.“I don’t know,” the officer said.“I didn’t know that,” Owings said.“Now, I am waiting to see if you have warrants through Woods County,” the officer said.“But I have to poop so bad,” Owings said.“Where do you think I was going?” the officer asked.“It’s my birthday,” Owings said. “It’s my [expletive] birthday.”Police then discovered there was a warrant out for her arrest for allegedly fighting an officer.“Why won’t you just let me go?” Owings asked.“Because your license is suspended!” the officer said.“I’m sorry I didn’t know,” Owings said. “Otherwise I won’t drive no more, but can I please go home and go poop?”The officer then called for backup.“If I can get you to step out of the vehicle for me,” the officer said.“Are you going to arrest me?” Owings said.“You are under arrest,” the officer said.“Are you kidding me?” Owings asked. “Why?”“You have warrants in Woods County and they are coming to get you,” the officer said.“No they are not!” Owings said. “[Expletive] you guys!”Owings put the key in the ignition and sped off. A pursuit lasted several blocks with speeds topping 70 miles per hour.Police say Owings blew through stop signs and a school zone. She eventually stopped and surrendered when officers pointed their guns at her.Owings would not let the subject drop as she was cuffed and taken to a squad car.“Can I poop in your car, man?” Owings asked.“You could’ve already been on your way to jail!” the officer said.“Yeah,” Owings said. “But not pooping!”Police searched Owings car and found a pipe with meth inside it. Owings was booked into the Garfield County Detention Center and faces several felony charges.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiz0oP9sNqY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yiz0oP9sNqY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Joe Biden QAnon Pizzagate Signaling</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 17, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">But of course!</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiUpX1DDcag" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FiUpX1DDcag/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Olivia Troye Abandons Trump Train Crash</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 17, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">As any sane person would.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNLwAo3UMIs" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wNLwAo3UMIs/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Prt2: Trump Says We're Going To Have A Woman President</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 17, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Who will it be?</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eST2LfmDDgQ" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eST2LfmDDgQ/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Shamanism is a Technology</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 17, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Feat.

Lee: The sense of grandiose omnipotence that he displays seems especially appealing to his emotionally-needy followers. No matter what the world says, he fights back against criticism, continues to lie in the face of truth, and above all is still president. What matters is that he is winning, not whether he is honest or law-abiding. This may seem puzzling to the rest of us, but when you are overcome with feelings of powerlessness, this type of cartoonish, exaggerated force is often more important than true ability. This is the more primitive morality, as we call it, of “might makes right,” which in normal development you grow out of by age five.But, in this case, Trump appeals to that childlike degree of emotional development? Why?Strongman-type personalities are very appealing in times of socioeconomic or political crisis, as the population is less able to think rationally but is rather overcome with fear, or desire to draw strength from fantastical ideas. This happens to normal people in times of stress, or to people whose development has been stunted because of emotional injury. The problem is, the person who promises the impossible and states, “I alone can fix it,” and gives himself an A+ on his performance, is not a strong person who can deliver but the opposite. So Mr. Trump’s “base“ looks for someone to rescue them and their intense yearning does not allow them to see through his deception, while Mr. Trump senses better than anyone their needs (they are his) and makes use of them for his own benefit—even as he disdains his supporters for being so gullible. In this manner, they fulfill each other’s emotional needs in a mutually unhealthy way.What’s your biggest concern?One concern I have, in my 20 years of studying this personality structure while treating violent offenders, is the disturbing societal trend. More and more of this personality type are taking on leadership positions, including of corporations, whereas 20 years ago one would mostly find them in jails and prisons. This also means there are a growing number of people who emulate them in the general culture, who become deprived from the structures that they create, and who become emotionally traumatized as a result of any of these consequences. People who are wounded this way continue to seek omnipotent parental figures as adults, and the vicious circle continues. Unable to find outer satisfaction for their inner needs, some keep pursuing ever greater power until they reach the highest positions, but since this is the opposite of proper treatment, their conditions only grow worse while society suffers a trail of carnage. It is actually a tragedy that Mr. Trump cannot receive proper care, even as his disorder is on display for the world to see, but is rather surrounded by those who enable his illness and make use of his weaknesses to their own destructive ends.On the one hand, different demographics that have tended to support Trump in the past—let’s say white women and neo-Nazis—don’t have much in common. Are there psychological factors that unite them?Well, he unites them through a common, mythological past that they can all be nostalgic for, and that might be his “talent.” We know from the former Yugoslavia that this past can be hundreds of years ago, not just decades, and is really a metaphor for discontent with the self in the present. Mr. Trump’s behavioral pattern is not that of leaders at all but rather of obsequious followers, as we have seen Mr. Trump become in the presence of even more successful strongmen, such as Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-Un, or Rodrigo Duterte. We find in him a pattern of following exactly what his base is looking for—he has no intrinsic philosophy or ideology but is responding to an emotional need for adulation and approval, and so he will try anything that gets as many people on board as possible. He will also sense keenly those who will never go along with his pathological methods—that is, healthy people—and drop them instantly. That is why we see him desperately clinging to an ever narrower base with increasingly fringe ideas.He also has to scapegoat groups in order to distract from his billionaire cabinet, tax breaks for the rich, and trade wars that hurt his base the most, and so his demonizing of other helpless groups will only increase with time.  There will likely be no limit to the violence he is capable of, since destroying the world would be nothing compared to the shame and humiliation he might suffer.Continued: https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/yale-psychiatrist-explains-devotion-trump-based-emotional-patterns-people-grow-age-five/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdH9vryaOHQ" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mdH9vryaOHQ/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Man Flashes Gun At Blacks Gets Arrested</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 15, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Milwaukee, WI@Justin H Trump is a pedophile and a criminal that has used Barr and others to be above the law. Republicans did not like him at first, but they are now in love with him. There a few never Trumpers, but not many. Saying "blacks aren't oppressed" only shows how naive and ignorant you truly are, but we already knew that. Segregation didn't end that long ago, and in some places it never ended. But for you dummies to think everything is fine, everyone is treated equal, and get equal pay. LOL pa lease. Are you that blind, or trolling on purpose? Blacks are stopped by the police 4 times as much as whites. And they are twice as likely to be killed by the police than whites are. And they get longer sentences. The FBI has for years said white supremacists are the real threat, the real domestic terrorists, and they are correct. You regurgitate outdated debunked The Great Replacement conspiracies, but are again prob to dumb to even know it. The police criminalize black communities, relocate resources from them, and fund their own police, and the suburbs. Gang activity is also a huge problem in many police forces. Some even get tattoos for when they get a kill. And have illegal arrest quotas. But you Trump dummies know nothing about that. So blind, so dumb, so naive, and so scared.You offer no solutions whatsoever. You hate america so much so, you can hardly wait to start offing your fellow Americans. Are you Russian? I actually hope you are. You should be getting paid for pushing the known propaganda to keep america divided.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRwHpJXPZdw" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRwHpJXPZdw/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump's Message for the West Coast</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 15, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Science does know: https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVEte8aPMK8" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SVEte8aPMK8/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Voter Suppression Live Rebuttal</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 15, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Smack down.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKK_auZROoc" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EKK_auZROoc/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">L.A.S.D Executioner</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 14, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">What if the 2 cops that were shot was an inside job?Sounds crazy, but it is a possibility.

And of course you went with social media disinformation, again. The 8 or 9 (depending on what video, post, or meme you saw) African Americans killed by police in 2019 vs the number of whites, fails to mention ratio. Of course there will be more whites killed. They make up the majority. African Americans are only 13% of the population. By ratio they are killed by the police over twice as much as whites. You also don't seem to understand socioeconomics and how that impacts crime rates, household income (money being the number one cause for couples fighting, and divorce) opportunity, racial profiling that increases crime rates, etc. African Americans are stopped by the police 4 times as much as whites are. If whites were stopped as much, their crime rate would be higher, even without socioeconomic impacts of ethnic groups. Nothing you have said is about solutions.

Then began sweeping arrests. When the police charge they typically push people down and either arrest them or tell them to get on the sidewalk. Protesters usually run from them during the bull rushes, either down the street some or run to the sidewalk like they are told. But after the bull rush the police continued to brutally arrests protesters that were on the sidewalk. Again, in Portland if you can outrun the cops they stop chasing you, and you wont go to jail. Unless they spot you later that night and can catch you. Anyway, so police were chasing people on the sidewalk. They chase one man down, shove up up against the wall, and then take him down. Almost right away something doesn't seem right with the protester. Police continue to handcuff him with a zip tie. Then the protester begins to throw-up, followed by multiple seizures. Police seem unsure what to do at first. And refuse to let BLM medics help. Eventually an ambulance arrives and takes him to the hospital. I assume he survived, because I have not heard anything about him afterwards.

Internet users typically submit links to news stories and articles about unusual or strange crimes or events occurring in Florida, particularly those where "Florida Man" is mentioned in the headline and has been wreaking havoc amongst social media. The meme calls attention to Florida's supposed notoriety for strange and unusual events. Miami New Times claimed that freedom of information laws in Florida make it easier for journalists to obtain information about arrests from the police than in other states and that this is responsible for the large number of news articles. A CNN article on this meme suggests that the breadth of reports of bizarre Florida Man activities is due to a confluence of factors including public records laws giving journalists fast and easy access to police reports, the relatively high and diverse population of the state, highly variable weather, and the lack of mental health funding.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XEYYA9xZQU" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XEYYA9xZQU/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump Caravan Attacks BLM</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 8, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Pro-Trump caravan of Proud Boys, Patriot Prayer, Back The Blue, Three Percenters militia group, among others.

Johnson said he, his wife, Lauren Hashian, and their young daughters, Tiana and Jasmine, all had the coronavirus and the family has been struggling with it for nearly three weeks. All four are currently in recovery, Johnson said.Johnson, 48, said there were trying times. The children didn't have severe symptoms, but the "Fast and Furious" star said it was unpleasant for him and Hashian. Johnson called it a "real kick in the gut" because his top priority is to protect his family and keep them safe from such a "relentless and unforgiving" affliction.Johnson said he and his family caught COVID-19 from family friends who visited them at their home. He said his family has been very cautious and he has not worked since March. Johnson urged his nearly 200 million followers on Instagram to remain disciplined, ask friends to get tested for the coronavirus before visiting them at home, boost their immune system and wear masks."I don't care what political party you're affiliated with, I don't care what part of the world you're from, I don't care what your skin color is, what your job is, what your bank account says -- I don't care," Johnson said. "I care about all of you and I don't want you -- or your entire family -- to get COVID-19."I do believe in hope, I do believe in optimism. I do believe in our doctors, our epidemiologists, our scientists who are all working so hard to deliver the vaccines for us. And that's gonna happen. But that's then. This is now. What we can do now is we can control the controllables."https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29797517/dwayne-rock-johnson-wife-daughters-covid-positive-johnson-announces</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuD2V9AzJI" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HGuD2V9AzJI/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Michael Reinoehl Killed by Police During Arrest</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 3, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Suspect in Fatal Portland Shooting Is Killed by Officers During ArrestLaw enforcement agents killed Michael Forest Reinoehl while trying to arrest him, four officials said.

(A list of BLAK’s demands online include the arrest of the four officers present at Blake’s shooting, the termination of the police chief and the creation of a citizens review board with subpoena power.) “So, I didn’t go off our demands strictly on the paper. I spoke straight from my heart. ... I felt like he needed to hear more of what was from our hearts.”“I’m only 31, and I’ve seen enough within these last two years to say I’m tired. I’m a mother. My oldest is 13. My twins are nine. I do this because I want their future to be better than what I have right now because my present is not good,” Bennett told Biden. “But I speak because I want the truth heard, and I speak for the people in this city because I live in this city and I’m out here with these people. A lot of people won’t tell the truth. But I’m telling the truth. It’s not what a lot of people think it is for us. We want the same exact rights as others.

Shooter is dead now:Michael Reinoehl Killed by Police During Arresthttps://youtu.be/HGuD2V9AzJI[Graphic] Michael Reinoehl Shot by Policehttps://youtu.be/nwq0cNSqp0o[Update] Aaron J. Danielson is not Jay Bishop, as was reported in the news. Mistakes happen. This video was made going by what information was out there at the time. The person yelling out "we got one over here," sounds like Chandler Pappas Witness account:"It was the Trump guy saying that, and he broke out pepper spray. Y'all weren't there. It was crazy. Possible self defense. When he sprayed, I thought it was gun, but the guy that got shot, was the aggressor.I'm just saying what I saw from my angle. The two trump guys yelled and pulled something out. Seemed like the shots and spray went off as same time. The shooter looked like he thought he was about to be shot, as did I.They were really aggressive. I'm guessing they thought they'd fuck with that guy, and didn't realize he had weapon to defend himself. Next time don't whip out pepper spray like you're about to do something. Not in this climate." @SquidBagBefore the media starting paying closer attention to Portland you had a smaller group of locals protesting there. Speakers in the day. Mostly idiots at night. And police clearing the streets like clockwork from 12am - 2am. A cat and mouse show. Contained in one small area. But once the media hype began, hella people starting going there from all over. Both pro and anti-blm. When the outsiders came it became really violent. Now it's a LARP show, lost is the cause. The shooter was actually shot in the arm in July during a different incident.Before the shooting the shooter was on a corner about a block over with a group of BLM guys on a bullhorn (video of that part: https://youtu.be/qpob1Kv6jZQ). The patriot prayer guys had been driving by them shooting pepper ball guns, and starting shit with them around 15-20 minutes prior. Then the shooter had left the group of BLM and was walking by himself now about a block over. That's when the patriot prayer guys saw him and yelled out "we got ONE right here." It was dark, the shooter had recently been shot himself a month ago and still had a bandage on from that. When the patriot guy went for his bear mace in his holster, it was dark people around the scene thought he was pulling a gun out. Kind of self defense. But even Ted Cruz is posting the lie that BLM "hunted" the patriot prayer guy down and shot him. smh. All the incorrect rumors caused me to make this video you are watching. Any cop would have thought the person was reaching for a gun. And you would defend it 100% if it was a cop that shot him. But you have let political bias twist you up. smh. The patriot boys were the aggressors, and both were known for carrying guns. And the shooter was just shot in the arm about a month ago, and still had the bandage on. Several witnesses said they thought the patriot guy was pulling out a gun. The shooter is quick to the draw and was ready, this time.Side Note: I'm a not a liberal, a democrap, a communist/socialist, I'm not antifa or any of trendy names some of you like to call me. I don't even support protesting of any kind during a pandemic. Before assuming nonsense about me, trying asking me first. I only care about getting to the bottom of things, not your dumb politics and it's lying politicians.

Prosecutors in Lake County filed the charges at noon Wednesday, and labelled him a fugitive who “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.”Tuesday was the third consecutive night of angry protests in Kenosha since police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, leaving him paralyzed.Rittenhouse, clad in a green t-shirt, a cap emblazoned with an American flag, and carrying an assault rifle, was seen on video at various points of the night. In several graphic videos, he’s seen opening fire on protesters; one was shot in the head, another in the chest. The victim who survived was shot in the arm.While it’s not immediately clear why Rittenhouse, a former police cadet, was at the protest, his social media indicates an affiliation with “Back the Blue,” a pro-police movement. In recent months, pro-cop vigilantes have been showing up heavily armed at protests across the country to defend public property, often warmly received by local law enforcement.Police interacted with the alleged gunman at various locations in Kenosha throughout the night. In one video, Rittenhouse is seen chatting with police who gave him a bottle of water and thanked him for being there.He was also seen in the vicinity of a group of armed militiamen, who had tasked themselves with protecting a gas station from damage. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth acknowledged their presence in an interview with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, but said he wasn’t sure if the suspected shooter was affiliated with them.The shooting started around 11.30 p.m., hours after the curfew, when a heated confrontation broke out between protesters and the militia men near the gas station. Around that same time, gunshots rang out by an auto-body shop, a few blocks away.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8pxj/a-17-year-old-aspiring-cop-has-been-charged-with-murder-in-kenosha</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v55Kp88bhdo" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v55Kp88bhdo/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">A Deer in The Headlights of Truth</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 25, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Watch the guy in blue with the "god bless america" sign.

"PORTLAND, Ore. — On Saturday afternoon, a large crowd of more than 100 far-right activists, including Proud Boys and armed militia members, descended on Portland, Ore., staging a “Back the Blue” rally in front of the Justice Center that houses the downtown police precinct. Hundreds of antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters gathered to oppose the far-right crowd.People in the far-right crowd came armed with paintball guns, metal rods, aluminum bats, fireworks, pepper spray, rifles and handguns. Some people in the opposing left-leaning crowd brought rocks, fireworks and bottles filled with chemical solutions. Both crowds sported shields and helmets.The two groups sparred for more than two hours, as people exchanged blows, fired paintballs at each other and blasted chemicals indiscriminately into the crowd. People lobbed fireworks back and forth. At least one person was hit in the abdomen with a device that flashed and exploded, causing bleeding.https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/22/portland-police-far-right-protest/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcHcYiiWZg" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCcHcYiiWZg/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">🐷 Porky 🐷</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 24, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">It's a sign.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcMGUWQzj9c" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GcMGUWQzj9c/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Chemtrails</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 23, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Caught on film.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9KYZF9UnU" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DE9KYZF9UnU/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Prt.1 Alt-Right Agitators vs BLM & Antifa</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 23, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Prt.2 Alt-Right Agitators vs BLM & Antifahttps://youtu.be/gBPUrdEQp2YA message for you boot licking Trump dummies at: 10:52One clip is in there more than once, whoops.

We decided to take our Jeep instead of the bike, as it was nearly 100 degrees. It was beautiful, it’s always beautiful. Rolling hills, and grasslands for miles, with the fresh scent of the pines, ever so fragrant. The bison were everywhere we went, herds and herds of them. They were frisky and punchy with each other, some trying to mate.We came around a curve just behind a group of motorcyclists and there was a herd standing in the middle of the road, most noticeably a cow (female) and her calf which was nursing. I popped out of the top of our Jeep to snap a few photos as we were at a stand still...Initially one woman got off her bike and approached the herd and then more followed. It was a tense moment, because John and I just knew they weren’t respecting these massive beautiful creatures space.BEFORE ⚠️ you watch, I need to apologize for the swear words, I didn’t even realize I was saying them until I listened. Trying not to swear...😬, the stupidity of this woman just got to me I guess.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO share this, so people understand they’re about to die when they confront an animal this powerful.

The money will come from eliminating the bureau’s gun violence reduction team and 38 positions tied to it.· $1 million to fund a leadership program for Black residents age 25 and younger. That money will come from cutting the bureau’s school resource officer program. An additional $900,000 in savings from that move will go to the general fund.· $1 million for programs to help the city’s houseless population, with the funding coming from eliminating eight positions in the police bureau’s Special Emergency Reaction Team, the agency’s equivalent of a SWAT team.· Around $600,000 will go to the city’s general fund, where it could later be allocated for an as-yet-undetermined use. The money will also come from eliminating the bureau’s gun violence reduction team.· $453,000 in social equity grants through the Office of Community and Civic Life, funded by redirecting $2.3 million in recreational cannabis tax revenue. The rest will stay in the cannabis tax fund, instead of going to the police bureau’s traffic division.· $150,000 will go to hiring another tribal outreach worker in the Office of Government Relations.· Around $124,000 will fund a position in the Office of Equity & Human Rights to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits public money from being spent in discriminatory ways.The city will also save $4.4 million by backing out of the multijurisdictional Transit Police and cutting or redirecting the 24 positions with it.https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/portland-passes-budget-with-millions-in-cuts-to-police-spending-but-short-of-public-demand-for-50-million-reduction.html</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcFyj4nAUAY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZcFyj4nAUAY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Falcon 9 Liftoff Downtown LA</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 9, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Time lapse</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJMaDnAy9fE" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GJMaDnAy9fE/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Google: White American Doctor</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 9, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Press image search.It's not some lone hacker, or employee.

Including confronting the truck driver after he left his truck, and the police stopping the truck driver while he was on foot (within 6 minutes the police had the driver)The driver could have went around like everyone else. He let road rage get the best of him. He pushed his way through one barricade of a car, motorbikes and people. Once past them there was nowhere else to go but into the crowd and the larger barricade with the fence that made it a dead end. The protesters are not mind readers. They did not know what his intentions were. The truck was now headed towards a large crowd of people. The protesters reacted quick in trying to stop the truck. When the motorcycle guy cut the truck off bumping into him, the truck stopped. Once the truck did stop, did the protesters overreact? Sure. And at that point there wasn't much the truck driver could do. Maybe he should have pulled out his gun then, instead of later, and then turned around and go out the way he came in.. which now would be easier to do, since the motorcycle line that was blocking the road had mostly left to chase him down. But the truck driver chose to instead drive 30-40 MPH through a crowd of people. Luckily they were all able to move out of the way."Demonstrations were held Tuesday, including a Black Lives Matter march, which is ongoing after beginning at North Portland’s Peninsula Park, and the nightly protest outside the Multnomah County Detention Center. Protesters have gathered near the downtown facility since late May, demonstrating against police brutality and anti-Black racism after the Minnesota police killing of George Floyd.About 100 protesters gathered in Peninsula Park about 8 p.m. and began the 1.3-mile march toward the Portland Police Association building on North Lombard Street shortly before 9 p.m. There, they chanted in the street and listened to speakers. The contents of one trash bin was set on fire on North Lombard Street.A shock was sent through the crowd after 11 p.m., when a pickup truck raced through a street where the crowd was assembled, metal sparks flying from the undercarriage where a motorcycle had been lodged.The driver abandoned the truck blocks from the scene, and photos showed the motorcycle underneath the front bumper. No injuries were immediately reported.Video on Twitter showed a man who appeared to be the driver carrying a handgun and yelling at protesters as he walked away. A police officer told an Oregonian/OregonLive reporter that police were speaking with the driver."https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portland-protests-against-police-brutality-anti-black-racism-continue-for-69th-day.html</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvlJlKbGAs" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/srvlJlKbGAs/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Front 242 - (Filtered) Pulse</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 5, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">1. 7Rain 00:002.

Photo of truck's plates: https://ibb.co/X3gdKSpUpdate 1: By the time his tire got slashed he had already broke through the other barrier, the smaller one with no fence, and was heading towards a large crowd of protesters in the street. They all had to move out of the way when he got to them, well over a 100 people. Then he smashed through the gate on the other side, he didn't go far and abandoned his truck with the motorcycle still under it, about two blocks away. The police talked to the driver, but have not charged or arrested him, they say it's "under investigation."Update 2: Turns out the driver had a had gun. When the protesters caught up to the truck and driver, the driver was out of his vehicle waving his gun around. The protesters followed him and directed the police to him.Update 3: Full video from beginning to end: https://youtu.be/TK1kUJhBE1wThe driver could have went around like everyone else.

Biden said most demonstrators are "peaceful protesters" who don't require a response from the federal government. "Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted," Biden said, and "local law enforcement can do that."Still, Biden said, "This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It's about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people's struggle and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome."And he said that means thinking about every policy debate in terms of structural inequalities.https://www.startribune.com/biden-says-post-pandemic-economy-can-fight-racial-inequality/571931472/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkW-hxCsh2E" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkW-hxCsh2E/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Man Attacks Police For Assaulting Woman</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">America, what have we become (or always been)?Possibly LAPD</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIMc4CdCI5g" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIMc4CdCI5g/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Umbrella Man Identified as Mitchell Carlson</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Mitchell Carlson is accused in a police search warrant application of being a Hell’s Angels biker who may be the notorious so-called “Umbrella Man” authorities believe purposely incited violence in Minneapolis by breaking windows at an AutoZone store after the death of George Floyd. He has not been charged with a crime but is under investigation, the application reveals.The application further accuses Carlson, who is a Minnesota man per his criminal history, of being a “full-fledged member of the Hell’s Angels” biker gang and a “known associate of the Aryan Cowboys” who police believe was purposely trying to stir up racial discord after Floyd’s death. Police described the Aryan Cowboys as “a known prison gang out of Minnesota and Kentucky.”https://heavy.com/news/2020/07/mitchell-carlson-umbrella-man/Minneapolis police say 'Umbrella Man' was a white supremacist trying to incite George Floyd riotingA masked man who was seen in a viral video smashing the windows of a south Minneapolis auto parts store during the George Floyd protests, earning him the moniker "Umbrella Man," is suspected of ties with a white supremacist group and sought to incite racial tension, police said.A Minneapolis police arson investigator said the act of vandalism at the AutoZone on E. Lake Street helped spark a chain reaction that led to days of looting and rioting. The store was among dozens of buildings across the city that burned to the ground in the days that followed."This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city," Sgt. Erika Christensen wrote in a search warrant affidavit filed in court this week. "Until the actions of the person your affiant has been calling 'Umbrella Man,' the protests had been relatively peaceful. The actions of this person created an atmosphere of hostility and tension. Your affiant believes that this individual's sole aim was to incite violence."https://www.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-floyd-rioting/571932272/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lKKYS0qbQ0" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6lKKYS0qbQ0/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Jim Jordan Peaceful Protest</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 28, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">If you want protesters to behave better. Address their causes and make sure that doesn't happen anymore. ie don't give them a reason to protest. duh dot comHistory has shown that the best way to end protesting for justice, is to meet the demands of the protesters. Since the bottom line in BLM protests is to end racism. The government should "limit" or "end" racism, and then there would be no need to protest. Jordan wants to bring focus on the reaction to injustice, and not the injustice itself. And in a strange twist it's quite possible that if Trump had mandated a national lockdown, George Floyd would still be alive. If a few bad protesters ruin an entire movement, what does a few bad cops do?A government doesn't announce that it has become fascist. They announce that anti-fascists are an enemy of the state.Jim Jordan's tactic is called a straw man fallacy. It's where you take the worst possible example, and use it to represent the whole. Most people grow out of that bad reasoning by high school.Jim Jordan's other mistake, or dishonesty, is pretending all bad things that happened were done by antifa, which is just simply not true. You had alt-right groups posing as antifa. You had lone wolves. Or fringe groups, some of which claim to be antifa like. And a whole lot of rumors. The obvious majority were regular people caught up in the moment during black lives matter protests. He also takes when people say "peaceful protest" he takes it out of context. Statues are not events. History teaches events. The statues were built years later. Most people never heard of many of them, until they make the news for coming down. Myths About Confederate Monumentshttps://youtu.be/55ehKPUm7dcDid you hear what happened in Boston?An unarmed teenage boy was hit in the head with the butt end of a firearm during a nonviolent verbal exchange with a law enforcement officer.Word of the incident quickly spread, and within an hour several people gathered in the area to peacefully protest. They shouted slogans, and business owners in the area closed up shop for fear of their property.The law enforcement officers called for backup, and backup arrived in the form of heavily armed law enforcement personnel. They then declared the assembly unlawful and ordered the protesters to disperse.The crowd, in response, grew restless and hurled dirt clods at law enforcement personnel. Law enforcement responded by firing into the crowd. The first person killed was a black man.If, while reading this story, you found yourself thinking that law enforcement was in the right and that the protesters should have dispersed, then congratulations you have fallen on the wrong side of history. You sided with the tyrant King George III.This incident occurred in 1770 and became known as the Boston Massacre, one of the key events leading to the American revolution. The man killed was Crispus Attucks.Racism was manufactured by the church, and later reinforced by governments. Racism is real, but it's built on an entirely false premise ie the idea that there are separate races of man. Explained...Race: a social construct, not a reality in science. It's just a way to categorize people by skin color. The reality is there are no separate races of humans living today. Skin color pigmentation is a result of geographical location to the equator. As homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, their skin color got lighter. This is due to combating UV rays while still trying to get the much needed vitamin D from the Sun. There were other small changes due to diet change and exposure to different disease/bacteria but none of the small changes are considered enough to be a different race, or sub race. So if someone hates a racial categorization of a group, or groups of people, they do so out of their lack of understanding in simple human biology, and categorization in social constructs. For an example Thursday is also a social construct, not a reality in science. Thursday (Thor's Day) isn't an actual thing. It's just a made up name to help us put some order into our social lives so we're not late for work. A way to figure out points in earth's rotation. Race is the same thing, but points in location, identified by skin pigmentation, during thousands of years of migration.Facts matter: Garbage collectors are more likely to die on the job than police patrol officershttps://qz.com/410585/garbage-collectors-are-more-likely-to-die-on-the-job-than-police-patrol-officers/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddrmQ7X3S64" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddrmQ7X3S64/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">NYPD Kidnap Organizer of a Peaceful Protest</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 28, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"Here's a better view of the NYPD kidnapping an organizer of a peaceful protest in Manhattan today.Whether or not these are feds, using plainclothes/unmarked officers & vehicles to kidnap people—who aren't even committing a crime—is absolutely terrifying." --Jesse Damiani</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF2Gn3fWhwo" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tF2Gn3fWhwo/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Nadler vs Barr FED Police For Trump Reelection</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 28, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Barr wiggles, squirms, and dodges</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iIYYhIhhkk" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iIYYhIhhkk/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Portland FED T-4 Strain</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 28, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Fascist Police State</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF2kjQEfhds" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF2kjQEfhds/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">FED Police Fight Women</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 27, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Portland, Oregon.

He was still in the crowd around 11:30 p.m. when federal officers used tear gas and other munitions to disperse the thousands of protesters outside the Multnomah County Justice Center."I'm not gonna lie, it stings, it's hard to breathe, and I can tell you with 100% honesty I saw nothing that provoked this response. It's nasty stuff, I'm not afraid but I am pissed off. This is an egregious overreaction on the part of the federal officers. There was nothing that I saw anybody do that warranted this reaction. As you can see, all it's done is piss everybody off. It's made everybody angry. They've come in and they kicked the hornet's nest. This is not a de-escalation strategy. This is flat out urban warfare and it's being brought on the people of this country by the president of the United States and it's got to stop now.

Have been brainwashed into promoting depopulation, euthanasia, and eugenics. Killing off the old and the weak with preexisting conditions. #GrandmaKillerSmart people stay home. Smart people practice social distancing and wear masks when they have to make a trip alone to the grocery store, or elsewhere. Smart people do this to keep the death rate low. And to prevent the government from having to overreach and force people to use commonsense. Be smart.Stupid people spread the disease, to the point that hospitals cannot care for everyone, and the death toll climbs. Stupid people give the government a reason to be tyrannical. Stupid people cause closure that destroy economies. Don't be stupid.Survival is about adapting. 100's of stores, skills people may have had, have came and went throughout our short history. Many could not adapt to the changing times. In desperate times, especially if one needs to feed their family, you go where the work is needed, or you provide what is needed. You adapt.

We can't trust the police to do it. We tried that, it did not work. We want to be able to combat police terrorism but also combat the violence in our own black communities," said New Era Las Vegas President Minister Stretch Sanders.New Era Las Vegas members handed out whistles at the park to women, children and the elderly, telling them to blow on the whistle if ever they are in need of help."Some of us will be armed with whistles and some of us will have pistols," said Sanders. He said the reason for pistols was to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms. "Anything that goes down while we are around, we're here to patrol it. We can protect and govern our own neighborhood as long as we are around it," said New Era Las Vegas member Damien Smith.Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said as long as members of New Era Las Vegas are abiding by open carrying laws, they are free to exercise their second amendment rights but remind residents to call police if they are in danger or to report a crime.https://www.fox5vegas.com/news/new-era-las-vegas-begins-civilian-patrols-in-historic-westside/article_ea13886a-c0df-11ea-b010-779c23672dd9.html#DefundThePolice</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzfva9CgH-U" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wzfva9CgH-U/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Adult Punches 12 Year Old Dancer</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 7, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Missouri police are searching for a man who punched a 12-year-old child in the face during a street dance performance last week — an incident that was captured on video on Facebook, where it soon went viral.Authorities in Cape Girardeau on Monday charged Cedric Charles Moore Jr. with second-degree assault and child endangerment, both felonies, but they are still searching for the 27-year-old and he has not yet been arrested.The incident occurred on the evening of July 3 as dance instructor Michael "Crank" Curry was holding a sidewalk dance performance with his students in Cape Girardeau, which is about two hours south of St. Louis.At around four minutes into the livestream, a black SUV pulls up to the corner where Curry and his students are stationed. A man gets out of the passenger side, dances up to the student who is performing, and hits him in the head, knocking him to the ground. The man then runs back to the car and the driver takes off.https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/olivianiland/cape-girardeau-missouri-dancer-attacked-video"The tough kid's name is Ethan, and his mother, Stephanie Hagler, tells TMZ ... more than 400 people -- family, friends and strangers alike -- have raised more than $14,000 so far to cover his medical bills and more."https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/08/missouri-assault-12-yo-kid-dancing-random-attack-fundraiser-help-bills/All about the attacker- Charles Moore Jr. https://heavy.com/news/2020/07/cedric-charles-moore/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4th6flARzZU" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4th6flARzZU/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Galapagos Giant Tortoises Return Home</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 7, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">This playboy tortoise had so much sex he saved his entire species.

Some of the funding for the Mount Rushmore project came from the KKK.The mountain that was chosen for the site of the monument is known as "The Six Grandfathers" (Thuŋkášila Šákpe) by Lakota peoples, named after the Earth, the Sky, and the four directions.The nine tribes of the Great Sioux Nation never agreed to or signed away their rights to this land; the Fort Laramie treaty in 1868, which the tribes did sign, guaranteed them "undisturbed use and occupation" of the land on which the Six Grandfathers, or Mount Rushmore, is on."Today, coinciding with a Trump/Pence rally in Keystone, SD, Indigenous activists plan to assert their right to unceded treaty lands.Read more: https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/thousands-gather-in-keystone-south-dakota-for-trump-pence-rally/Support our work: https://unicornriot.ninja/donateAll Unicorn Riot media is re-distributable under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Creative Commons 3.0 US License (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US): https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/Unicorn Riot: your alternative mediawww.unicornriot.ninjaFull video (4 hours 25 min long): https://www.facebook.com/unicornriot.ninja/videos/651005862183259/?__tn__=kCH-R</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ynt5Mv1Rb4" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ynt5Mv1Rb4/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Bird Catches Shark</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 2, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">That's right.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60IZm0LYtDA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60IZm0LYtDA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Israel Annexing West Bank of Palestinians</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 2, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Between 2.1 million and 3 million (sources vary) Palestinian Arabs live in the West Bank under both limited self-rule and Israeli military rule.The West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) is also home to some 430,000 Israeli Jews who live in 132 settlements (and 124 smaller "outposts") built under Israel's occupation.The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US under the Trump administration dispute this interpretation.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52756427</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEU-fufhAlo" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEU-fufhAlo/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">All Cuts Matter</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 1, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Claira Janover makes a good point with her analogy.

You sink or swim.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHokp-KIyEw" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qHokp-KIyEw/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump on Mount Rushmore</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 27, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">He finally made it.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCbVkz31bhE" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SCbVkz31bhE/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Anarchy Doesn't Like Anarchy</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Seattle</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp8oYQqDXw" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSp8oYQqDXw/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">BLM Jesus Christ Is The Most Famous Black Radical Revolutionary In History</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">And they will worship the white man's God.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txYYCqr_bFQ" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/txYYCqr_bFQ/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">DC Protesters Attack Jack Posobiec</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Black Bloc / AntifaFull Video: https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=3580697085279681&ref=watch_permalink</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg5OyatJakg" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qg5OyatJakg/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump Has Given Up</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">USA Number One</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j3EPP40zPE" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4j3EPP40zPE/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump's Greatest Accomplishment: An Obama Bill</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">H.R.3230 - Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3230</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcw_Fikf7vI" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wcw_Fikf7vI/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Tommy Decentralized - Apocalyptic City</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 25, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Yamaha MODX</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaB3Whd11s" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vAaB3Whd11s/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Donald Trump Makes Fun of Donald Trump</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">haha</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw8fL-5spQ8" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cw8fL-5spQ8/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Fook The Police</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Instant Karma</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfBkUqUSHY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMfBkUqUSHY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Protesters Topple Father Serra Statue</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 20, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">San Francisco, California: Catholic priest Junípero Serra abused and enslaved the Chumash people (native american Indians).</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4NIro1Uu5U" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4NIro1Uu5U/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Liberalism is a Mental Disorder Part 2</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 19, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">I can't even...</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVBn0SY4JeY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVBn0SY4JeY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Protesters Topple & Burn Gen.

All had their origins in this basic idea of a heavenly phallus.Once man had worked out his theory about the divine rain, he thought he could help to stimulate rain in much the same way as he did orgasms on earth; by singing, dancing, orgiastic displays and, above all, by performing the sex act—particularly in the fields, where the sacred semen was most needed.It was then a natural step to want to share the secrets of how to control the power and knowledge of the heavenly phallus.But how?Over the centuries there were those who experimented with herbs and drugs and, as I shall show, came upon one drug that really seemed to transport them out of this world into heaven.But this knowledge was not to be shared indiscriminately. If god was jealous of his powers, so were those to whom he gave this glimpse of divinity. Paradise was for the favoured few.And so there arose the priesthood with its secret preparations and ceremonies that had to be observed before the chosen ones could take the drug—rituals that gave them great powers over the rest of the community."http://www.johnallegro.org/popular-press/popular-press-by-john-allegro/sacred-mushroom-and-the-cross-sunday-mirror-1970/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbEg7jMyVcE" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YbEg7jMyVcE/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Black on Black Crime is a Misdirection</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 16, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Black-on-black crime is nothing other than a talking point used to derail.You've all heard it, some of you have said it. It usually goes something like this: "Police? Why aren't we talking about black-on-black crime, that’s the real problem."Want to know why no one talks about it? Because you're not actually interested. The reality is black activists address crime within itself all the time. Others only seem to want to address it when we talk about crimes being committed against us, by uniformed officers. If you truly cared, you would be talking along with us instead of at us.By the way, do you know who overwhelmingly commits the crimes against white people? White people. At almost identical rates, because crimes are carried out due to proximity, but we don’t say white-on-white crime, do we?Blacks rob blacks. Latinos rob Latinos. Asians rob Asians. Whites rob whites, and on and on and on. But we only hear about one, making it seem as if the community itself is not concerned about crime, and nothing could be further from the truth.But the real flaw in this argument is the simple fact that when a black person commits a crime against another black person, or a white person against another whiter person, and so forth, that person faces justice --something that happens less than 1 percent of the time when the perpetrator is a cop.It's not just that police brutality exists, it’s also there is little to no accountability for it. And I don't think the police or anybody making this argument would be agreeable to applying the same standard of crime and punishment to those who protect and serve as we do to black-on-black crime. And the reality is we shouldn't apply the same standard. The standard for our police force should be much higher.https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/get-up-dc/george-floyd-defund-police-black-on-black-crime-talk-is-misdirection-by-opponents/65-251bd43a-d150-400f-9f05-a55d3a103bee</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxXLDK4ew7M" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LxXLDK4ew7M/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Patriot Shoots BLM Protester Over Statue in NM</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 15, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">ALBUQUERQUE — Gunfire broke out during a protest Monday night in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico whose image has become the latest target in demonstrations across the country aimed at righting a history of racial injustice.As dozens of people gathered around a statue of Oñate, New Mexico’s 16th-century colonial governor, shouting matches erupted over proposals to take it down and a man was shot, prompting police officers in riot gear to rush in.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/conquistador-onate-albuquerque-new-mexico-unrest.html</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdNqanyF7Ac" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XdNqanyF7Ac/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Vigilantes Attack Reporter, Police Take Their Side</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 13, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"Vigilantes gathering with bats and guns at the statue of Christopher Columbus at Columbus Square in South Philadelphia, some of them just assaulted our reporter."Source: https://twitter.com/UR_Ninja------------"How The Antifa Fantasy Spread In Small Towns Across The USRumors of roving bands of Antifa have followed small protests all over the United States.

F your two party system of utter crap, seriously. I attack all politicians and don't give a F. I hate them all, Obama, the Clinton's, all of them. Trump is boring because he's too easy to make fun of. But he's also a boldfaced liar and a horrible president. 100%1. Trump promised to bring down America’s trade deficit “as fast as possible.” Instead, the trade deficit has hit an all-time high. The United States is now purchasing more goods and services from the rest of the world than we sell abroad than at any time in history.2. As a presidential candidate in 2016, he said he could completely eliminate the federal debt in 8 years. Instead, the federal debt has exploded thanks to Trump and the GOP’s $1.9 trillion tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. They’re already using the growing debt to threaten cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.3. He promised to boost the wages of American workers, including a $4,000 pay raise for the average American family. Instead, wages for most Americans have been flat, adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, over the same period, corporate profits have soared and the rich have become far richer, but the gains haven’t trickled down.4. His administration said that corporations would invest their savings from tax cuts. Instead, corporations spent more money buying back shares of their own stock in 2018 than they invested in new equipment or facilities. These stock buybacks provide no real benefit for the economy, but boost executive bonuses and payouts for wealthy investors.5. He promised a tax cut for middle-class families. Instead most Americans will end up paying more by 2027.6. He promised to keep jobs in America and crack down on companies that ship jobs overseas. Instead, his tax law has created financial incentives for corporations to expand their operations abroad. Trump’s trade wars have also encouraged companies like Harley Davidson to move production overseas.7. He promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington lobbyists. Instead, he’s put them in charge of health, safety, and environmental protections–which has endangered most Americans while increasing corporate profits even further.The real recipe for economic growth is to invest in Americans–in their health, education, job training, and infrastructure.But Trumponomics has exploded the deficit, hurt ordinary Americans, and lined the pockets of the wealthy and corporations. Don’t let Trump and Republicans claim otherwise.Use any sources you like, it all checks out. here are some:In Blow to Trump, America’s Trade Deficit in Goods Hits Record $891 Billionhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/us-trade-deficit.htmlFederal deficit to top $1 trillion under Trumphttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/28/federal-deficit-one-trillion-trump-107901$1.5 trillion tax cut had no major impact on business spendinghttps://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/1-5-trillion-tax-cut-had-no-major-impact-business-n963411Trump opens door to Social Security cutshttps://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-23/trump-social-securityTrump now says he's open to entitlement cuts, including Medicarehttps://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/politics/donald-trump-medicare-entitlements-cuts/index.htmlFor most U.S. workers, real wages have barely budged in decadeshttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/Paychecks Lag as Profits Soar, and Prices Erode Wage Gainshttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/business/economy/wages-workers-profits.htmlStock Buybacks Top Capex for First Time Since 2008, Citi Sayshttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-03/stock-buybacks-top-capex-for-first-time-since-2008-citi-saysTrump Increases Individual Income Tax Rateshttps://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/2018/54787Trump Has Created 1.5 Million Fewer Jobs Than Obamahttps://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/09/20/trump-has-created-15-million-fewer-jobs-than-obama/#27b87ed027ceHarley-Davidson Is Moving Some Production Overseas to Deal With the EU-Trump Trade Warhttps://fortune.com/2018/06/25/harley-davidson-trump-trade-war-eu/Trump's Efforts To 'Drain The Swamp' Lagging Behind His Campaign Rhetorichttps://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525551816/trumps-efforts-to-drain-the-swamp-lagging-behind-his-campaign-rhetoricTrump outpaces Obama, Bush in naming ex-lobbyists to Cabinethttps://apnews.com/08dce0f5f9c24a6aa355cd0aab3747d9</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzJv0JE7AOE" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzJv0JE7AOE/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Statue Falls On Protester</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 11, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">A man was injured when a Confederate statue at a monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, was topped by demonstrators Wednesday.Sgt.

Another protester reiterated the point, saying "It doesn’t just stop in Minneapolis.""Our youth is what’s important. This city is more than a tourist city it has residents here," said another protester. "That’s kind of an extreme way to go, defunding the police.

He represents more than 500 state officers from various agencies, but not Las Vegas Metropolitan Police."We want to be better," he said.

He also rejects a report in the Sunday Examiner which labeled the Black Panthers as being "anti-white," by declaring that: "We don't hate nobody because of their color. We hate oppression!" It should be noted that James (Bobby) Hutton can be seen standing behind Seale and to the left, wearing a hat. He was killed by the Oakland Police Department on April 6th, 1968. Footage from his funeral and speeches afterwards (by Seale and Marlon Brando) may be seen in news film report KTVU 16, shot on April 17th 1968.

This view is shared by all scientists who study variation in human populations. Yet racial prejudice and intolerance based on the myth of race remain deeply ingrained in Western society. In his powerful examination of a persistent, false, and poisonous idea, Robert Sussman explores how race emerged as a social construct from early biblical justifications to the pseudoscientific studies of today.The Myth of Race traces the origins of modern racist ideology to the Spanish Inquisition, revealing how sixteenth-century theories of racial degeneration became a crucial justification for Western imperialism and slavery. In the nineteenth century, these theories fused with Darwinism to produce the highly influential and pernicious eugenics movement. Believing that traits from cranial shape to raw intelligence were immutable, eugenicists developed hierarchies that classified certain races, especially fair-skinned “Aryans,” as superior to others. These ideologues proposed programs of intelligence testing, selective breeding, and human sterilization―policies that fed straight into Nazi genocide. Sussman examines how opponents of eugenics, guided by the German-American anthropologist Franz Boas’s new, scientifically supported concept of culture, exposed fallacies in racist thinking.Although eugenics is now widely discredited, some groups and individuals today claim a new scientific basis for old racist assumptions. Pondering the continuing influence of racist research and thought, despite all evidence to the contrary, Sussman explains why―when it comes to race―too many people still mistake bigotry for science."https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Race-Troubling-Persistence-Unscientific/dp/067466003Xhttps://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660038</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEIOfBkbxLY" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEIOfBkbxLY/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">How to Bunker</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 7, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Like a president.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhcNklmQ3OU" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lhcNklmQ3OU/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Legacy: George Floyd</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 7, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Give me my freedomFor as long as I beAll I ask of livin'Is to have no chains on me ✊George was an average American.

But judge "they" will. Now ask yourself, who are "they," and why should you care? They are the people that do not want change, they fear it, and cling to racist ideologies. We don't give a fook what "they" say. America has changed many times, and will continue to do so.

I am not an expert. But I may have a little insight from having been into punk rock and anarchism back in the day, as well as being antiwar. We've crossed paths many times, and often shared some of the same views. Although back then they did not go by antifa, they went by ARA (Anti-Racist Action). From Wikipedia:."Anti-Racist Action was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the late 1980s by members of the anti-fascist skinhead group Minneapolis Baldies, left-wing punk rock fans, and other activists. ARA then expanded to several communities in the United States and Canada. Members of Love and Rage, a revolutionary anarchist organization, played a major role in building ARA groups and the ARA Network in the 1990s, and the group's structure was formalized in 1994 at the first Midwest Anti-Fascist Network conference, in Columbus, Ohio. Anti-Racist Action is cited as a precursor to the American movement later known as Antifa.".Wikipedia does not mention that the Minneapolis Baldies Gang was from the 50's and 60's and would fight against the Greasers.So what is antifa (anti-fascism) and where did it come from?Obviously anti-fascism has a deep history as an opposition to fascist regimes and ideologies. Especially in Italy as an opposition to Mussolini. But also in Germany as an opposition to Hitler's Nazis.After WW2 anti-fascism started to become popular again in the 1970's and 80's as an opposition to white supremacy and skinheads, who were infiltrating the punk rock scene (this happened where I live, as it happened elsewhere too). That's when they began to make their way across the US.In the 1970's and prior in the US they were not really called anti-fascist, but rather labeled as communists or communist sympathizers, during the "red scare" fear of communism cold-war propaganda..In the 1990's racial tension came to a head with the Rodney King beating, and the riots that would follow. And at the same time the alt-right was growing in the conspiracy underground. They were anti-big government, anti-police state, pro-second amendment, pro-free trade, pro-capitalism, and so on. But also into hella NWO conspiracies. Especially after the Randy Weaver incident at Ruby Ridge and what happened in Waco. Among other things going on. Including the Gulf War. The fear was already set previously with Reagan/Bush and their NWO talk..Then came 9/11, Bush, and The Patriot Act in the early 2000's. For a while there it almost seemed as if there was a bit of unity in standing up to what many viewed as a coming police state. There were plenty of racists around. But for a short time it was also the people vs the man (police state, NWO)..Portland Oregon became a protest hot spot for anti-Bush, antiwar, anti-nwo, anti-fascism, and anti-police state. There were tons of protests taking place in Portland. The people vs the state. During this time the police began to film and take pictures of protesters, and would try and identify them, to spy on, and or charge and arrest them. So covering your face to keep the police from identifying you, and wearing all black, became more common during the protests..But Portland is also notorious for neo-nazis and white nationalists. Over the next decade a shift began and the alt-right became pro-police, and pro-government (conservative) to some extent. And the ARA in Portland morphed into Antifa, as an opposition to the alt-right white nationalists, and supremacists. One cannot be anti something, without that "something" existing first..Links:Eye Of The StormEye of the Storm uses video footage shot by the police at events in Portland, OR to confirm how the police target citizens engaged in constitutionally protected acts of protest for harassment, assault, and arrest. The police, by their own admission, assault law-abiding protesters without provocation then lie about being provoked.

Racism was manufactured by the church, and later reinforced by governments. Racism is real, but it's built on an entirely false premise ie the idea that there are separate races of man. Explained...Race: a social construct, not a reality in science. It's just a way to categorize people by skin color. The reality is there are no separate races of humans living today. Skin color pigmentation is a result of geographical location to the equator. As homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, their skin color got lighter. This is due to combating UV rays while still trying to get the much needed vitamin D from the Sun. There were other small changes due to diet change and exposure to different disease/bacteria but none of the small changes are considered enough to be a different race, or sub race. So if someone hates a racial categorization of a group, or groups of people, they do so out of their lack of understanding in simple human biology, and categorization in social constructs. For an example Thursday is also a social construct, not a reality in science. Thursday (Thor's Day) isn't an actual thing. It's just a made up name to help us put some order into our social lives so we're not late for work. A way to figure out points in earth's rotation. Race is the same thing, but points in location, identified by skin pigmentation, during thousands of years of migration."Modern scholarship regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)#GeorgeFloyd#Protests</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9k9AGODw7k" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b9k9AGODw7k/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">I Don’t See No Riot Here, Why Are You In Riot Gear?</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 3, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Crowd chants#GeorgeFloyd#Protest</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiPUgiva6k" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bbiPUgiva6k/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">White Privilege Example?</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 3, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"At the very beginning of this video, in the lower right hand corner, there is a white woman who smiles and waves to the camera as their car is allowed to pass.

A suspect was arrested.Another shooting — involving police — took place on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse where police encountered a man who was armed, Lombardo said.“At approximately 11:22 p.m., officers encountered a subject who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body Armour. During the interaction, the subject reached for his firearm and the officers engaged. The suspect was struck by gunfire and was transported to UMC where he was pronounced dead,” he said. “With these protests that are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another.”This is the ninth officer involved shooting of 2020. Per LVMPD policy, the identity of the officers involved will be released after 48 hours.https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/web-extra-sheriff-lombardo-news-conference-on-shootings-that-left-metro-officer-in-grave-condition-and-suspect-dead/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZPLvDcCys" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RfZPLvDcCys/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Kentucky Police Shoot Store Owner David McAtee</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 1, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">LOUISVILLE, Ky.

No matter what the world says, he fights back against criticism, continues to lie in the face of truth, and above all is still president. What matters is that he is winning, not whether he is honest or law-abiding.This may seem puzzling to the rest of us, but when you are overcome with feelings of powerlessness, this type of cartoon-ish, exaggerated force is often more important than true ability. This is the more primitive morality, as we call it, of "might makes right," which in normal development you grow out of by age five." -Bandy X.

In reality, $500 million divided by 327 million Americans is about $1.53 per person."When I read it tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear," Williams said.The tweet read: "Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. The U.S. Population, 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and have had lunch money left over.""It’s an incredible way of putting it," Williams said."It’s an incredible way of putting it," Gay said. "It’s true. It’s disturbing."The twitter user they cited has since made their account private, after perhaps the most successful instance of trolling public figures in positions of authority in history.https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/06/msnbcs_brian_williams_new_york_times_editorial_board_member_mara_gay_five_divided_by_three_equals_one_million.html</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9-_aTgQipc" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C9-_aTgQipc/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Elizabeth Warren's Dog Bailey Steals Burrito</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Mar 5, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">"Bailey legit just swiped someone’s burrito.""We are all Bailey"#Bailey</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whv5eKSaKs4" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/whv5eKSaKs4/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Joe Biden Tomorrow is Super Thursday</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Mar 2, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Super duper man.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KToIPq4E_Cc" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KToIPq4E_Cc/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump on Coronavirus (Full)</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Feb 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Trump puts Mike Pence in charge of Coronavirus.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndQoSl5Ub3g" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndQoSl5Ub3g/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Trump puts Pence in charge of Coronavirus</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Feb 26, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Did Trump forget about this: Mike Pence’s Response to H.I.V.

The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified in the report that was sent to Congress this week.The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified, but could not assign fault in 497 cases.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG1KAKRsc48" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xG1KAKRsc48/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Tommy Decentralized - How Dare You [Feat.

wrapped up after several arrests, several accidents and a heavy police presence. There was no large-scale attempt to invade the heavily guarded military base that’s about two hours north of Las Vegas.Local and federal authorities say the events ran smoothly. No one knew just how many people would show up, but Lincoln County had to be prepared after the excitement over a Facebook post that drew worldwide interest.The I-Team has learned that Lincoln County might sue Matty Roberts, the man who created the Facebook event, to help recoup the cost of the resources used over the weekend.Fewer than 10 people were cited for trespassing near Area 51. The number of injuries and arrests were much fewer than anyone expected, considering the million-plus RSVPs on the Storm Area 51 Facebook page that started it all.Numbers on how much this all cost Lincoln and Nye counties are not yet available. One Lincoln County commissioner said he’s impressed with visitors cleaning up after themselves. He said visitors left it cleaner than they found it.https://www.8newsnow.com/news/lawsuit-might-follow-stormarea51-but-events-posed-few-problems/</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NsuHeuiXOA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4NsuHeuiXOA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Biden vs Trump on Ukraine</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Sep 22, 2019</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Two wrongs do not make a right.

She then opens the door and steps in. Again, she’s told “go inside” and responds this time, “I am, you idiot.”“It was pretty surreal to see that armband,” Jedeed told Storyful, “you can see from the video that no one wanted to beat up some lady, but they needed her to stop being a Nazi.”Jedeed told Storyful that after she stopped recording, “someone threw something at her window and the neighbors applauded.”Portland Police reported a protest at the city’s East Precinct the same night. In the early hours of August 6, they said a fire was started at the building, and they declared the gathering a riot.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 69.6%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGGB4hEghCM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CGGB4hEghCM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Rioting thugs trying to blind resident with lasers, violently intimidating & harassing her in PDX</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 6, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">After Antifa & Black Lives Matter rioters were dispersed by both Portland Police and State Troopers,  following the attack on the East Precinct, they tried to blind a woman at her home with lasers, attacking her - both physically and violently intimidating her.. .

This is after they set fire to the east precinct” [Tweet, Andy Ngo @MrAndyNgo]. . “Don't point a laser at anyone's eyes. The display of the Swastika is protected speech by the First Amendement (not in Germany though). Keep your hands to yourself, especially if you are on private property.

DailyMail.com has exclusively obtained video from the bodycams of officers Thomas Lane and Alex Kueng, who were part of Floyd's fatal arrest on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. Floyd died after Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for nine minutes on May 25. The tapes show in minute detail how Floyd begs 'Mr. Officer, please don't shoot me. Please man,' before the struggle that ended with his death. It also shows how Floyd resisted as the cops tried to force him into the back of the car, telling them he suffers from claustrophobia and anxiety. The video begins with Lane knocking on Floyd's car window with a flashlight and once Floyd opens the door, Lane pulls out his gun and points it at Floyd's head. Floyd, 46, begs him not to shoot, saying: ''I'll look at you eye-to-eye. Please don't shoot me man. I just lost my mom, man'. He sobs as the officers pull him out of the car and handcuff him, as his ex suggests he was undergoing mental problems and was afraid of police. After the struggle to get Floyd in the cop car, he is suddenly on the sidewalk with Chauvin's knee on his neck. Floyd says he can't breathe numerous times and calls for his 'momma' but his voice slowly gets weaker as his life drains away, even saying 'I'll probably just die this way'.. .

Claira Janover, who graduated in May with a degree in government and psychology, went viral after posting a short clip in which she attacked anyone with “the nerve, the sheer entitled caucasity to say ‘all lives matter.'”. . “I’ma stab you,” the Connecticut native said, zooming in close on her face.. . “I’ma stab you, and while you’re struggling and bleeding out, I’ma show you my paper cut and say, ‘My cut matters too,'” she added.. . Ann Coulter was one of those who shared the clip, calling Janover an “Asian Karen,” while many others called for the student’s arrest.. . “This woman is threatening people, who knows what she is capable of,” someone called Mr. Len wrote in reply.. . “Does this not count as violent speech? I guess it only counts when it fits the narrative,” another follower asked on Twitter.. . By Tuesday, Janover had removed the original video — but posted updates responding to the “insane” reaction that included numerous death threats, she said.. . “Story time for why the Department of Homeland might be monitoring my name right now,” she started one of the updates.. . Janover claimed the clip was “clearly” an “analogous joke,” pointing out that she even posted a message with it explicitly stating: “For legal reasons this is a joke.”. . “And people are like reporting me for domestic terrorism, tagging the FBI, Harvard, Cambridge police,” she said.. . “Apparently I’m threatening the lives of people — unlike cops, obviously,” she said.. . “Anyway, so If I get an email from the Department of Homeland Security or I get kicked out of Harvard or I get arrested or whatever — or I get murdered, according to the many death threats that I’m receiving right now — know that I appreciate you guys standing up for me,” she said as she posted a series of supportive messages.. . In an earlier post, she had laughed over many of the angry responses her TikTok got — including one suggesting she could be a Chinese spy with a Western-sounding name to help infiltrate the US.. . One called her the c-word, while another wrote, “Maybe someone should stab her for being oppressive! She is the problem, and all like her!”. . “They quite literally did blow up my Twitter,” she said.. . Just before midnight Tuesday, Janover tweeted about the “death, rape, expulsion, and firing threats” she got.. . “I will not be silenced, shamed, or threatened into silence by bigoted trump fans who don’t understand analogies,” she wrote.. . Her message received a lot of support — along with numerous replies of “all lives matter,” with some telling her, “You reap what you sow.”. . “I’m the bigot if I don’t like your violent hate speech. Riiiight. You’re one sick person,” one person told her.. . Another noted the irony of her complaint given that it was started by threats of violence.. . “‘I WILL STAB YOU IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME!!!’ … two hours later … ‘Help! people are saying mean and hurty things to me,'” one person wrote.. . Janover was the president of Harvard’s Model Congress Middle East, a nonprofit that teaches high school students about the American government and international politics. She previously worked at Planned Parenthood Action in Connecticut, her Facebook says.. .

D.C. Black tours shocked protesters at the emancipation statue in the US Capital City Washington recently when he took charge of the megaphone and started to call out the crowd on their history and why they shouldn’t be wanting to tear down the statue.. . . The D.C. tour guide famous for his guerilla marketing techniques struck again, this time with two causes, save the statue and advertise his tours. The crowd watched and listened in dismay as he lectured them on their history when they expected him to be agreeable to their cause.. . Frustrated protests have amalgamated on statues in recent weeks. Opportunistic hanger ons to the black lives matter cause saw an opportunity for their own self gain in recent weeks and started damaging and looting in cities all over the states, this soon spread to different cities throughout the world. Off the back of the rioting and looting the anger spread to the protests and statues were targeted as a way to bring more coverage to the cause. The statues which are seen by the protesters as vile remnants of a by gone era, which they feel no longer hold a place in a multi cultural society which indeed the brass effigies of the models portrayed helped create.. . Like it or not, this is History. It won’t be destroyed by pulling down a statue nor will it be forgotten. All societies should own their history, learn from the bad and good and not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 96.14458%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiYZ__Ww02c" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiYZ__Ww02c/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">How to Sell Protest Footage to FOX AND CNN</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 15, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">I am a videographer who has figured out the technique to sell my footage to both of these news outlets.

Minnesota also To Deploy Record Guard Force To Contain Unrest Over Death Of George Floyd. By Colin Dwyer. NPR.org, May 30, 2020 · Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET. Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard.. "It was not enough," Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday.. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis.. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — "an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard," according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen.. "We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder," the governor said Saturday.. "But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life.". The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor.. Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence.. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video.. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans.. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police.. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year.. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL.. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order "to help keep peace in Louisville.". "I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear," Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. "But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe.". President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to "get tougher" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called "radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this.". "They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart," Trump said of state officials. "We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military.". In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is "real and legitimate," the protests are "being hijacked by violent radical elements."</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 91.460676%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG0yrng0eY4" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sG0yrng0eY4/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Killer Mike - Atlanta - Mayor's Press Conference #georgefloyd</p><p class="youtube-video-date">May 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Michael Render speaking after TI at the Mayor's press conference, following the burning & vandalism after peaceful protest march for #georgefloyd, 20200529.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 98.89493999999999%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLzQefpBvM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ftLzQefpBvM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Police arrest CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and crew on live television</p><p class="youtube-video-date">May 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">CNN's Omar Jimenez was taken into police custody during a live broadcast at the site of the protests in Minneapolis, after clearly identifying himself to officers.

Discretion is advised. . . Protests were underway in Louisville, Ky., for a third night after a grand jury did not bring charges against Louisville police for the killing of Breonna Taylor during a drug raid gone wrong, with prosecutors saying the two officers that fired their weapons that hit the Black woman were justified in using force to protect themselves. . . The charges brought by the grand jury were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into Taylor's neighbours' homes during the raid on the night of March 13. The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. . . Earlier on Friday, the family of Taylor and their lawyer demanded the release of all body camera footage, police files and transcripts of the grand jury hearings. . . Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor's case became a major touchstone for the nationwide protests that have gripped the U.S. since May — drawing attention to entrenched systemic racism and demands for police reform. . .

Discretion is advised.. . A helmet camera on Wednesday captured tense clashes in Portland, Ore. between police and people protesting the recent grand jury decision in connection to the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was shot in the hallway of her apartment in March by Louisville, Ky. police during a botched drug raid.. . The three officers connected to the case face no charges in relation to her death. Instead, one former detective was indicted on three counts of "wanton endangerment" for recklessly shooting into neighbouring apartments during the raid.. .

He said that as they deployed to investigate the crowd, shots were fired. One officer is in stable condition, the other officer is undergoing surgery but is in stable condition. . . Schroeder said he is concerned about the safety of his officers and that community safety is of utmost importance.. . The only charges brought by the grand jury in Taylor's death, which occurred during a drug raid gone wrong, saw now-fired officer Brent Hankison facing three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into Taylor's neighbours' homes during the raid on March 13. . . Prosecutors say the two officers that fired the weapons which hit and killed the Black woman were justified in using force to protect themselves. The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case.. . For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7354761/breonna-taylor-death-protests-kentucky/. .

The officers' lawyers are reportedly using a defence in which they are highlighting Floyd's past crimes and history of drug use, seen as a "blame the victim" approach. They are also seizing on Floyd's reported medical issues and addiction, saying he likely died from fentanyl and not after officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.. . Crump said in a press conference after a hearing, in which the officers' lawyers argued for their trials to be held separately, that the only overdose that killed Floyd "was an overdose of excessive force and racism by the Minneapolis Police Department.". . Asked about the arguments for separate trials, attorney Scott Masterson responded with three words: "Guilty is guilty.". .

Reinoehl had the warrant issued for his arrest earlier Thursday, and was allegedly involved in the shooting of Aaron Danielson, after the later was among a caravan of Trump supporters who rode pickup trucks into downtown Portland and clashed with protesters demonstrating against racial injustice and police brutality.. . .

McEnany demanded that Pelosi apologizes "for the American people" as she wants small businesses to shut down but "only reopen for her convenience." . . Pelosi said Wednesday she takes responsibility for trusting the word of a San Francisco hair salon that it was OK to come in for a solo visit — even though the city still does not allow indoor beauty services because of the coronavirus pandemic.. . McEnany went on defending Trump's recent comments suggesting people vote by mail and in-person twice in the upcoming elections saying “the President doesn’t condone unlawful voting” and accused the media of taking his comments out of context.. . She refused to answer a question by a journalist on whether voting twice in the same election is illegal in the U.S. or not. . . Some states do allow voters to ask to have their mail-in ballot to be invalidated, but intentionally voting twice is fraud in most states.. .  The White House press secretary also addressed the recent findings of a Germany report that Alexei Navalny, a prominent Russian opposition figure, was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok, saying "we're deeply troubled” by those results and describing the murder attempt “completely reprehensible.”. .

Stewart of New York said on Thursday that the officers and sergeant involved in the death of Daniel Prude should be fired, charged with homicide, and prosecuted. Prude was a 41-year-old Black man who died on March 30 of asphyxiation, seven days after a group of police officers put a hood over his head - ostensibly to prevent spitting - and then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, as seen on video of the incident which was recently released to the public.. . Stewart also called for the people who surrounded him during Thursday's news conference to have the "bogus" charges against them dropped, though did not specify what they had been arrested for. He went on to say that a commission was organized by the city a month ago to investigate structural racism in Rochester and Monroe County, but Stewart says they put in their own appointed people and not community activists, adding they were "half-stepping" with the action. He said they plan to establish a people's commission to look into systemic racism on various topics including education, criminal justice, health care and gun violence.. .

Biden began his visit to the battleground state of Wisconsin on Thursday by meeting with the family of Jacob Blake.  Biden spent more than an hour in private with Blake's father, Jacob Blake Sr., his siblings, and one of his attorneys, B'Ivory LaMarr. Blake's mother Julia Jackson and another attorney, Ben Crump, joined by phone.. . Biden followed his meeting with Blake's family and representatives with a community discussion at Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha. The gathering included business and civic leaders and at least two representatives of law enforcement.. . At the church, Biden said of Trump: "No president's ever going to say `they're very fine people on both sides.' No president has ever said anything like that ... It legitimizes the dark side of human nature." . . Biden was referring to Trump's comments after a 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.. . The Rev. Jonathan Barker, pastor of the church, opened the meeting with a prayer asking for "justice for Jacob Blake" and for God to "anoint" a national leader in November who will "seek justice, love mercy ... and love their neighbour.". .

The former vice-president also responded to questions on how far he would “push” his campaign schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic to get his message out, saying that a president “must set an example” of ensuring safety.

He also joked about the upcoming presidential debates against Trump, saying he had been preparing by listening to what the president has said and "all the lies he's told," and that he'd like to see a scroller along the bottom of the screen to instantly fact check both of the candidates.

Walz said he doesn't condone the actions and there would be consequences for those who toppled the statue, but said no order was issued for law enforcement or other officials to not interfere with protesters. He said, however, that they need to have discussions with the public to understand the motivating factors that led to the tear down of the statue. Walz also said that people cannot compare the statue being taken down by protesters to those looting or burning a store as being comparable.. . Flanagan also spoke about the issue and said she would "not shed a tear" over the "loss of a statue" that honoured a man she says oversaw "genocide." She said they need to build a process about artwork, imagery and symbols on and in the Capitol, that is community-driven and transparent.. . The protest that led to the tear down of the Columbus statue comes after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.

However, the PM said in his opinion he felt it was too important for the leader of the country not to be present for the rally, and to listen to issues that are impacting so many Canadians and rallying so many people around the world. . . "It was important for me to attend," Trudeau told reporters. "As best I could, I followed social distancing measures....but for me, it was important that I be there to hear." . .

He said police need to be able to say "we are part of the problem" and recognize they don't have the authority to "bully" because they have a badge and a gun.. . Peterkin also said that police around the world need to do some "house cleaning" and that if officers see problems within the force, "get it out of your house.". . The sheriff also commented on the amount of time it took for all four officers seen in the video taken prior to Floyd's death to be arrested, saying if the circumstances were different, there would have been a “national manhunt” and immediate murder charges.. .

Tim Walz, U.S. President Donald Trump and former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden reacted on Wednesday to the death of George Floyd.. . Frey on Wednesday called for Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the white police officer who arrested George Floyd, a black man, and was seen on video appearing to press his knee onto Floyd’s neck. Floyd could be heard saying that he could not breathe and eventually stopped moving. The officer was one of four fired a day after Floyd's death, but it's not yet known whether the incident will be considered criminal.. . Walz commented that seeing the video left him "shocked and horrified," and said that he shared "that primal scream of watching humanity get erased in front of you." Attorney general Keith Ellison, who joined Walz, said the investigation would proceed with a degree of objectivity, but stressed they were dealing with a "systemic problem" and change needs to happen.. . Trump made brief remarks while at the Kennedy Space Center for the eventual scrubbed mission of the SpaceX Demo-2 launch, saying it was a "very, very sad" event and they would look into the incident.. . Prior to a discussion with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, Biden also spoke saying that George Floyd's "life mattered" and said the video reminded him of Eric Garner, another black man who died in 2014 after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold. Garner, like Floyd, had told the officer he couldn't breathe prior to his death. The former vice president said that while the firing of the officers was right, they had to "ensure the Floyd family receives the justice they're entitled to" and said more is needed than just the officers' firing.. .

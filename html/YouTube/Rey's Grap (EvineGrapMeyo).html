One of the arrestees vomited during the arrest, shaking badly from unknown reasons - whether it was a seizure or drug related. Protesting bystanders were yelling intensely at the cops - while literally what seemed like a ocean of photographers & videographers were standing on each other’s necks to get THAT footage of what could have been the next nationwide headline with a black man (resisting arrest and) dying during an arrest. No doubt some Black Lives Matter supporters were waiting for the situation to turn out in their favor - especially since the crowd always has a lot of rioters posing as fake press. Fortunately AMR responders came to the scene, made sure he got on a stretcher an driven of for medical attention.

As reported thru the last week or so, Portland Police have increased the action towards actively targeting rioters for arrests.

The agents, dispatched by the Trump administration over vociferous objections of state and city officials, are part of a force that has fired projectiles at and detained activists protesting nightly since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police May 25.Numerous photos and videos posted on Twitter show the unidentified woman as she halted in the middle of the street at about 1:45 a.m. She stood calmly, a surreal image of human vulnerability in the face of an overpowering force that has been criticized nationally by civil rights advocates.The agents, in gas masks and helmets, continued firing pepper balls in a staccato “pop, pop, pop” heard on video, aiming low at the asphalt, where puffs of smoke mingled with clouds of gas. At one point, a fellow protester, clothed, carrying a homemade shield, darted in front of the woman, angling to protect her.But the woman sidestepped him. He jumped out of the way, perhaps realizing that he made them both a target.Before it was over, she struck ballet poses and reclined on the street. She also sat on the asphalt in a yoga-like position, facing officers, before they left.Portland has long been loved, or mocked, for its streak of earnest but quirky organic earthiness, as portrayed in the “Portlandia” television comedy series. Sometimes the envelope-pushing forms of expression involve nudity.A Portland tavern owner, Bud Clark, gained fame during the 1980s before his election as mayor via a popular “expose yourself to art” poster showing him in a raincoat discreetly flashing a bronze nude sculpture.Courts have held that appearing nude in Portland is a protected form of political expression, superseding bans on public indecency.In 2008, a Multnomah County judge cleared a nude bicyclist of indecent exposure charges, saying cycling naked had become a “well established tradition” in Portland as a form of “symbolic protest.” Four years later, a man was acquitted of similar charges by a judge who interpreted his stripping naked at Portland International Airport as a legitimate form of protest against Transportation Security Administration procedures.The woman making her statement Saturday was altogether uninhibited, at one point standing on one leg and raising her arms in an arc-type motion.As she struck ballet poses, a patrol car arrived and a dozen officers in blue uniforms replaced the line of agents, whom officials described as having been targeted by protesters throwing rocks, bottles and pieces of metal. She sat in the street facing them, legs spread in the headlights’ glare.</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN7L32Dx9-M" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VN7L32Dx9-M/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">The Power of Rioters actually stopped other rioters from harassing AMR personnel</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 12, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">#Portlandteargas #PortlandRiots #PortlandPolice #EMT #Chicago #ChaosRioters actually stopped other rioters from harassing AMR personnel responding to help injured man#LasseBurholtWhile Police were issuing warnings not to enter the Portland Penumbra Kelly Building on East Southside, someone appeared to fall off the back of a pickup too. “Police came over to help the injured man.

The display of the Swastika is protected speech by the First Amendement (not in Germany though). Keep your hands to yourself, especially if you are on private property. This is not non-violent protest. White folks have hijacked the BLM” [Tweet: Paul Robeson @No_Signal00] “Portland Mayor Wheeler on last night's protests in East Portland, during a press call: "Last night 200-300 people went to the East Precinct intent on violence. The violence I am talking about is not vandalism. I mean specifically violence against people”</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tneaLAYRTA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3tneaLAYRTA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Black Lives Matter, Naked Athena Explains Protest: A Fury Arose In me</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Aug 2, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">#BlackLivesMatter #Portlandteargas #protest #RiotDownload: https://linksly.co/35OBb7Out of Portland tear gas, an apparition emerges, capturing the imagination of protestersAn unidentified woman, wearing only a face mask and a cap, sits in a Portland, Ore., street early Saturday morning, facing law enforcement officers who held back protesters.PORTLAND, Ore. —  She emerged as an apparition from clouds of tear gas as federal agents fired pepper balls at angry protesters in the early Saturday darkness.A woman wearing nothing but a black face mask and a stocking cap strode toward a dozen heavily armed agents attired in camouflage fatigues, lined up across a downtown Portland street. The agents, dispatched by the Trump administration over vociferous objections of state and city officials, are part of a force that has fired projectiles at and detained activists protesting nightly since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police May 25.Numerous photos and videos posted on Twitter show the unidentified woman as she halted in the middle of the street at about 1:45 a.m. She stood calmly, a surreal image of human vulnerability in the face of an overpowering force that has been criticized nationally by civil rights advocates.The agents, in gas masks and helmets, continued firing pepper balls in a staccato “pop, pop, pop” heard on video, aiming low at the asphalt, where puffs of smoke mingled with clouds of gas. At one point, a fellow protester, clothed, carrying a homemade shield, darted in front of the woman, angling to protect her.But the woman sidestepped him. He jumped out of the way, perhaps realizing that he made them both a target.Before it was over, she struck ballet poses and reclined on the street.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson described the action as a "legitimate and necessary response" to US provocation. Hours earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo outlined the Trump administration's assertive stance on China, as trade and diplomatic tensions rise between the two nations.Why is the Chengdu consulate important?"Beijing’s order to close the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, the westernmost of the five American consulates in mainland China, deprives the United States of its most valuable diplomatic outpost for gathering information on Xinjiang and Tibet, the two sometimes-restive regions in China’s far west." The move comes after the US ordered China to close a diplomatic outpost in Houston over espionage allegations "Administration officials this week accused Chinese diplomats in Houston of aiding economic espionage and the attempted theft of scientific research in numerous cases across the United States."</p></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1oYmS6bi2I" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z1oYmS6bi2I/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">China say US orders it to close Chinese consulate in Houston to close in 3 days</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 22, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">U.S. orders Chinese consulate in Houston to close in 3 daysChina vowed retaliation after the U.S. forced the closure of its Houston consulate, in one of the biggest blows to diplomatic ties between the two countries in decades.

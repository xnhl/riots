Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death appeared for an omnibus hearing Friday, no cameras were allowed — just as at all other hearings so far in the case.. . But as they came out of the court, protesters screamed and chanted, "You're a killer.". . Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the family court building as the trial was underway.. . Prosecutors in the case of four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd told a judge Friday that the men should face trial together because the evidence and charges against them are similar, and multiple trials could traumatize witnesses and Floyd's family.. . But defense attorneys have argued for separate trials, saying they would likely offer "antagonistic" defenses and the evidence against one officer could negatively impact another.. . The former officers appeared in court Friday for a hearing on the prosecution's request to hold a joint trial, a defense request to move the trial out of Minneapolis, and other issues. . . Judge Peter Cahill took most issues under advisement, but granted a defense request to remove a local prosecutor from the case.. . Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd said he couldn't breathe. . . Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. . . Thomas Lane, J.

The gathering included business and civic leaders and at least two representatives of law enforcement. . . He heard from Kenosha residents discussing the need to address systemic racism so that society - including commerce - will function peacefully. . . “I look at the buildings in our community that are gone,” said Barb DeBerge, owner of DeBerge Framing &amp; Gallery, which still stands. “I just I don’t think I really grieved as much as I should because being a business owner, I have to keep going, I have to keep working.”. . "I know legally why a lot of officers who kill black men and women are not held legally responsible, criminally, legally responsible for their actions," said Angela Cunningham, a Black attorney in Kenosha.. . "Because the law protects them," she said. . .   . . The trip, Biden's first to Wisconsin of the general election campaign, is intended to draw sharp contrasts with President Donald Trump. . . He called for an increase in the minimum wage, expanded housing opportunities and mandatory rehabilitation programs for drug abuse, instead of prison, among other things. . . Biden also criticized President Trump without mentioning him by name by referring to Trump's comments after a 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.. . Trump told reporters at that time that there were "very fine people on both sides.". . "The words of a president matter," Biden said.. . No matter if they are good, bad or indifferent.

Tony Evers told vigilantes to stay out of Kenosha on a day when prosecutors charged a 17-year-old from Illinois in the fatal shooting of two protesters and the wounding of a third.. . The deadly violence happened during a night of unrest following the weekend police shooting of Jacob Blake.. . "I would like to disinvite all those people that are running around with long guns for no apparent reason to stay home.". . Kyle Rittenhouse faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. . . He would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, the most serious crime in Wisconsin.. . "What do you think is going to happen if you have an agitated man with a long gun walking down the streets thinking that he's some sort of peacekeeper," said Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who joined Evers for a press conference in Kenosha.. .  "That kind of behavior shouldn't be enabled either.". . Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Kenosha, was taken into custody Wednesday in Illinois. He was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing Friday on his transfer to Wisconsin. Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.. . Rittenhouse’s attorney, Lin Wood, said the teenager was acting in self-defense. . . Evers has authorized the deployment of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops in the city of 100,000. Guard troops from Arizona, Michigan and Alabama were coming to Wisconsin to assist, Evers said Thursday. He did not say how many.. . Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, the state's adjutant general, said the National Guard members will keep the city, so protesters can peacefully demonstrate. And he said those guardsmen coming from out of state will be under his command, and ultimately under the command of the state's governor.. . Evers also said he wants the state legislature to convene next week to begin to take up police reform. He Also defended his handling of the crisis, saying he has provided local authorities will all the assistance they've asked for since the unrest began.. . . .

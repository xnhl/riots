Adam Haner fund. I'm Brian Haner. Just moved to Apache Junction AZ two weeks ago .  Adam Haner's is my little brother. He's living in Portland, I was right across the river from him in Vancouver WA before I moved. Hoping this money will help Adam get things together for his life after the attack he suffered. I know he will need repairs, or to replace the truck that was wrecked. He is going to need time to recover from his injuries as well. Plus replace things that where stolen from his pick-up that night, on Aug 16th. which happens to be my birthday. His girlfriend had some help getting his truck towed home while he slept tonight, Aug 17th. Maybe he will use some of this money to move out of Portland, or just use it to move up. I really don't care what he uses it for. He would give the shirt off his back to help any of the people around him, and he really didn't deserve what happened to him in Portland. I'll supply updates here as I can, and may update the 'story' on the GFM to better detail how this will all get handled. I really through this up in a hurry, because I was getting so many messages to start the GFM for him. After spending most of my day looking for information on what happened to him, and letting my mom and family know he was alive and home, I started replying to all the DM's and messages on social media, and started this GFM and replied to as many massages as I could. I currently have enough free time in Arizona to mostly keep up with something this demanding. So hopefully, I'll get to reply to all of you that have question, want proof it's really for Adam, and get you updates as there is information available. Huge Thank You to everyone showing him support. This is going to be an awakening experience for my brother in so many ways. He's always been cynical about the world at large, but has always been someone willing to step up and speak up to help someone being treated unfairly.. . https://www.gofundme.com/f/adam-haner-fund?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 96.92307400000001%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7XGrSBw5M" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1w7XGrSBw5M/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Portland Peaceful Rioters Start Fire In Government Building.

Starting in May 2020, demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd have been held in the city of Portland, Oregon, concurrent with protests in other cities around the United States and around the world. As of July 2020, many of the protests, which have been held every day since May 28, have drawn more than 1,000 participants.[1] Some of the protests have been entirely peaceful, while others have involved heated confrontations with police, sometimes involving injury, declaration of riot, and use of tear gas and other weapons. The Oregon chapter of the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the City of Portland, the Portland Police Bureau, and other law enforcement entities on June 28, claiming that police targeted and attacked journalists and legal observers.[2] In early July, the federal government sent law enforcement officers to Portland, and engaged in tactics that have been criticized by Portland's mayor and most of the state's congressional delegation.. . Background. Main articles: Killing of George Floyd, George Floyd protests, List of George Floyd protests in the United States, and George Floyd protests in Oregon. Further information: Black Lives Matter and Police brutality in the United States. Along with related demonstrations across the United States and around the world, associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, these protests were initially precipitated by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by police in Minneapolis. Other recent police killings of people of color, including Breonna Taylor, contributed to the national unrest driving the protests. The local protests also draw attention to a number of other homicides in recent decades, including the 2017 Portland train attack, the 2003 shooting of Kendra James, and others. Several assaults and killings during the summer of 2020, including Israel Berry and Shai-India Harris, contributed to the unrest.</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 81.53845799999999%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbB5uSZKbRc" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sbB5uSZKbRc/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CLAT Portland Protest 7/17/2020 The View From The Internet</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 17, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Federal Law Enforcement Use Unmarked Vehicles To Grab Protesters Off Portland Streets. https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/. .

The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ),[6] also known as Free Capitol Hill,[7][8] the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest,[9][10] or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP),[11][12][13][14] was an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone[1] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park,[15][16] was established on June 8, 2020 by George Floyd protesters after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) left its East Precinct building,[2] and was cleared of occupants by police on July 1, 2020.[3][17]. . Formation of the zone in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was preceded by a week of tense interactions between protesters and police in full riot gear that began on June 1 and escalated on June 7, after a man drove his vehicle into the protesters and shot one of them (near 11th Ave. and Pine St.).[18][19] Tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper spray were repeatedly used by police in the densely populated residential neighborhood,[20] while the SPD said in its Twitter account that the crowd was "throwing bottles, rocks, fireworks, and other projectiles at officers. The crowd is shining green lasers into officers’ eyes."[18] The mayor issued a ban on tear gas on June 5,[21] while the following day, flash bangs and pepper spray were used on demonstrators after they were joined on the front lines by a group of city, county, and state representatives.[22] Near midnight on June 8, tear gas was deployed again, despite the ban.[22] Afterward, police boarded up and moved out of the East Precinct in an effort to de-escalate the situation.[23]. . Local governance in the zone was decentralized, with the goal of creating a neighborhood without police. On June 9, 2020, protesters demanded rent control, the reversal of gentrification, the abolition or defunding of police, funding of community health, and releasing prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest, with expungement of their records.[24][25]. . Reactions to the zone varied through the political spectrum. President Donald Trump referred to the occupants as "ugly Anarchists" and called for the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle to "take back" the zone, criticising what was a perceived lack of response to an armed uprising conducted by Far-Left ANTIFA groups[5] while Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 11 described the zone as "four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public."[26] On June 14, USA Today confirmed a festive atmosphere, comparing the protest to a miniature version of Burning Man.[27] The following week, on June 22, the Associated Press stated "[a]t night, however, the atmosphere has become more charged, with demonstrators marching and armed volunteer guards keeping watch."[28] SPD Chief Carmen Best at first said the department was looking at different approaches to "reduce [their] footprint" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood,[29] but later stated officials were working to return officers to the precinct. She stressed the "need to have officers responding to calls in a timely fashion. And with the occupation that's taking place, we're not able to do so in a timely way."[30]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 82.222224%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtx0sw771BA" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtx0sw771BA/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">National Guard To Deploy In Atlanta Gov Declares State Of Emergency After 31 People Shot in 2 days</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jul 6, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">National Guard To Deploy In Atlanta, Gov.

The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park,[15][16] was established on June 8, 2020 by George Floyd protesters after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) left its East Precinct building,[2] and was cleared of occupants by police on July 1, 2020.[3][17]. . Formation of the zone in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was preceded by a week of tense interactions between protesters and police in full riot gear that began on June 1 and escalated on June 7, after a man drove his vehicle into the protesters and shot one of them (near 11th Ave. and Pine St.).[18][19] Tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper spray were repeatedly used by police in the densely populated residential neighborhood,[20] while the SPD said in its Twitter account that the crowd was "throwing bottles, rocks, fireworks, and other projectiles at officers. The crowd is shining green lasers into officers’ eyes."[18] The mayor issued a ban on tear gas on June 5,[21] while the following day, flash bangs and pepper spray were used on demonstrators after they were joined on the front lines by a group of city, county, and state representatives.[22] Near midnight on June 8, tear gas was deployed again, despite the ban.[22] Afterward, police boarded up and moved out of the East Precinct in an effort to de-escalate the situation.[23]. . Local governance in the zone was decentralized, with the goal of creating a neighborhood without police. On June 9, 2020, protesters demanded rent control, the reversal of gentrification, the abolition or defunding of police, funding of community health, and releasing prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest, with expungement of their records.[24][25]. . Reactions to the zone varied through the political spectrum. President Donald Trump referred to the occupants as "ugly Anarchists" and called for the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle to "take back" the zone,[5] while Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 11 described the zone as "four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public."[26] On June 14, USA Today confirmed a festive atmosphere, comparing the protest to a miniature version of Burning Man.[27] The following week, on June 22, the Associated Press stated "[a]t night, however, the atmosphere has become more charged, with demonstrators marching and armed volunteer guards keeping watch."[28] SPD Chief Carmen Best at first said the department was looking at different approaches to "reduce [their] footprint" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood,[29] but later stated officials were working to return officers to the precinct. She stressed the "need to have officers responding to calls in a timely fashion. And with the occupation that's taking place, we're not able to do so in a timely way."[30]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 87.764702%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUxq-VDT4Wk" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUxq-VDT4Wk/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHAZ #CHOP Journal 7/3/2020 CHAZ Night Shift Brings The Heat.

The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ),[5] also known as Free Capitol Hill,[6][7] the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest,[8][9] and the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP),[10][11][12][13] is an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone[1] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park,[14][15] was established by George Floyd protesters on June 8, 2020 after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) vacated its East Precinct building.. . On June 22, Mayor Durkan said the violence was distracting from the message of thousands of peaceful protesters. "We cannot let acts of violence define this movement for change," she said, adding that the city "will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill." At the same press conference, Police Chief Best spoke of "groups of individuals engaging in shootings, a rape, assault, burglary, arson and property destruction." She added, "I cannot stand by, not another second and watch another black man, or anyone really, die in our streets while people aggressively thwart the efforts of police and other first responders from rescuing them."[105] The mayor announced that officials are working with the community to bring the zone to an end.[103] "It's time for people to go home," she said, "to restore order and eliminate the violence on Capitol Hill."[106]. . On June 23, there was a third shooting within a span of four days near the zone, leaving a man in his thirties with wounds that were not life-threatening. SPD was reportedly investigating, but the victim refused to provide information about the attack or describe a suspect.[107] Also on June 23, Seattle's KIRO-TV reported that 33-year-old DeJuan Young, who was critically wounded on June 20, was shot in a separate incident by different people and a block away from where Lorenzo Anderson was mortally wounded. His shooting, said Young, was motivated by racism. "So basically I was shot by, I'm not sure if they're Proud Boys or KKK," said Young from his hospital bed. "But the verbiage that they said was hold this 'N-----' and shot me." He worries that his case is not being properly investigated. "I understand everybody's going to say, 'Oh, it was the CHAZ zone and ya'll asked for the police not to be there, so don't act like ya'll need them now."[108] Technically, however, Young was outside the zone.[109] "I was in Seattle streets," he said. "So what's the excuse now?"[108]. . A fourth shooting within the zone in ten days[43] occurred in the early morning hours of June 29. A 16-year-old boy was killed and a 14-year-old boy was in critical condition with gunshot injuries.[42] While searching for evidence, SPD discovered that the crime scene had been disturbed.[44] Police have made no arrests in any of the shootings at CHOP since June 20.[110]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 97.090912%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWVcaY2lopI" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lWVcaY2lopI/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHAZ #CHOP Journal 6/28/2020 Return Of The Homeless People</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 29, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Periscope of Chaz's last stand on the Police Station . https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyGBapLbMEKN. .

The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ),[5] also known as Free Capitol Hill,[6][7] the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest,[8][9] and the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP),[10][11][12][13] is an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone[1] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park,[14][15] was established by George Floyd protesters on June 8, 2020 after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) vacated its East Precinct building.[2]. . Formation of the zone in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was preceded by a week of tense interactions between protestors and police in full riot gear that began on June 1 and escalated on June 7, after a man drove his vehicle into the protestors and shot one of them (near 11th Ave. and Pine St).[16][17] Tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper spray were repeatedly used by police in the densely populated residential neighborhood in early June. The mayor issued a ban on tear gas on June 5,[18] while the following day, flash bangs and pepper spray were used on demonstrators after they were joined on the front lines by a group of city, county, and state representatives.[19] Near midnight on June 8, tear gas was deployed again, despite the ban.[19] Afterward, police boarded up and vacated the East Precinct in an effort to de-escalate the situation.[20]. . Local governance in the zone was decentralized, with the goal of creating a neighborhood without police. On June 9, 2020, protesters demanded rent control, the reversal of gentrification, the abolition or defunding of police, funding of community health, and releasing prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest, with expungement of their records.[21][22]. . Reactions to the zone varied through the political spectrum. President Donald Trump referred to the occupants as "ugly Anarchists" and called for the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle to "take back" the zone,[4] while Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 11 described the zone as "four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public."[23] On June 14, USA Today confirmed a festive atmosphere, comparing the protest to a miniature version of Burning Man.[24] The following week, on June 22, the Associated Press stated "[a]t night, however, the atmosphere has become more charged, with demonstrators marching and armed volunteer guards keeping watch."[25]. . Following the zone's founding, SPD Chief Carmen Best said that the police department was looking at different approaches to "reduce [their] footprint" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood[26] but later said that officials were working to return police officers to the precinct. She stressed the "need to have officers responding to calls in a timely fashion. And with the occupation that's taking place, we're not able to do so in a timely way."[27]. . On June 12, Black Lives Matter protesters were reportedly negotiating with local officials over terms for leaving the zone.[28] Four days later, the zone's roadblocks were replaced and moved,[29] allowing for emergency service vehicles to pass through and decreasing CHAZ's size to three blocks.[30] After shootings in or near the zone resulted in injuries and one death, Durkan stated that the SPD would return to the East Precinct "peacefully and in the near future".[31][32] On June 24, a statement tweeted by an account titled "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (Official Account)" said that "the CHOP project is now concluded,"[33][34] though protesters interviewed in the zone were unaware of the announcement or of any plans to disband CHOP.[35] Multiple sources reported that, after the weekend of June 20, the zone's footprint shrank[35][36] and some occupiers left.[37][38] City transportation crews arrived in the zone on the morning of June 26 to remove barricades set up by demonstrators, but halted work when a protester laid in the street to block their heavy equipment.[39] That afternoon, Durkan met with a group of protesters. After the meeting, the city's plan was reported to be to remove most of the CHOP barricades by the end of June 28, limiting the CHOP area to the East Precinct building and the street directly in front of it.[40][41] On June 27, one day after KOMO-TV reported the number of protesters remaining in the zone had "dwindled to a few dozen",[42] The Wall Street Journal estimated several hundred demonstrators remained.[43] On the evening of June 28, KIRO-TV reported that the zone</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 92.72727%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBTDqO2o_7g" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pBTDqO2o_7g/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHAZ #CHOP Journal 6/25/2020 Final Report.

On June 7, the day prior the zone's founding, a man drove into a crowd of protesters and shot another man who reached into his car and tried to stop him. The victim was not seriously injured.[74][42]. . On June 20 at 2:19 a.m., local residents reported gunshots in the zone to 9-1-1. At least seven shots were fired in under three seconds.[75] After being transported to the hospital by volunteers,[76][77] a 19-year-old man died[10] from multiple gunshot wounds[78] and a 33-year-old man[79] was in critical condition with life-threatening injuries. The shooting occurred at Cal Anderson Park, one block from the empty East Precinct building, abandoned on June 8. SPD attempted to respond but was, according to its blotter, "met by a violent crowd that prevented officers safe access to the victims."[10][74] The New York Times reported that as armed police in riot gear entered the zone, protesters screamed, "The victim left the premises!"[80] City Council member Lisa Herbold, chair of the public safety committee, said the suggestion that the crowd interfered with access to victims "defies belief".[26] A departmental spokeswoman said SPD is reviewing public-source video and body camera video, some of which SPD released,[81][82] but no suspects were in custody. SPD has not determined a motive for the shooting.[74][80] CHOP representatives released a statement saying that the individuals involved may have had history, which seemed to escalate because of "gang affiliations".[83] The Seattle Times reported that the teenager who was killed was an African American[78] and had graduated from high school the previous day.[75] The King County medical examiner's office confirmed the victim's identity as Horace Lorenzo Anderson, who went by his middle name.[78] KIRO-TV reported that he was also a local rapper known as "Lil Mob".[84]. . Another shooting occurred on June 21, the second such incident in the zone in less than 48 hours. After being transported in a private vehicle to Harborview Medical Center, a 17-year-old male was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and released.

Durkan said the city would attempt to phase down nighttime activity in the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area, known as CHOP — or earlier, as CHAZ — but would not be using police to clear the zone.

SPD has not determined a motive for the shooting.[59][68] CHOP representatives released a statement saying that the individuals involved may have had history, which seemed to escalate because of "gang affiliations".[72] The Seattle Times reported that the teenager who was killed was Black[66] and had graduated from high school the previous day.[63] The King County medical examiner's office confirmed the victim's identity as Horace Lorenzo Anderson, who went by his middle name.[66] KIRO-TV reported that he was also a local rapper known as "Lil Mob".[73] City Council member Kshama Sawant said there were "indications that this may have been a right-wing attack" for which President Trump would bear "direct responsibility, since he has fomented reactionary hatred specifically against the peaceful Capitol Hill occupation".[74][75]. . Another shooting occurred on June 21, the second such incident in the zone in less than 48 hours. After being transported in a private vehicle to Harborview Medical Center, a 17-year-old male was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and released. He declined to speak with SPD detectives.[76][77]. . On June 22, Mayor Durkan said the violence was distracting from the message of thousands of peaceful protesters. "We cannot let acts of violence define this movement for change," she said, adding that the city "will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill." At the same press conference, Police Chief Best spoke of "groups of individuals engaging in shootings, a rape, assault, burglary, arson and property destruction." She added, "I cannot stand by, not another second and watch another black man, or anyone really, die in our streets while people aggressively thwart the efforts of police and other first responders from rescuing them."[78] The mayor announced that officials are working with the community to bring the zone to an end.[76] "It's time for people to go home," she said, "to restore order and eliminate the violence on Capitol Hill."[79]. . On June 23, there was a third shooting within a span of four days near the zone, leaving a man with wounds that were not life-threatening. SPD was reportedly investigating.[80]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 100%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uegU9IJsDYM" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uegU9IJsDYM/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">Seattle will phase down CHOP at night, police will return to East Precinct, Durkan says</p><p class="youtube-video-date">Jun 22, 2020</p><p class="youtube-video-description">Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said Monday that the Seattle Police Department will be returning to its abandoned East Precinct building “peacefully and in the near future,” following a weekend in which three people were shot in the protest area that has emerged around the building.. . Durkan said the city would attempt to phase down nighttime activity in the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area, known as CHOP or CHAZ, but would not be using police to clear the zone. Rather, Durkan said, they’d ask people to leave the area voluntarily at night, offering resources for those going through homelessness and working with community groups to try to cajole people to leave the area, where dozens of tents have sprouted up in recent weeks, along with couches, guerrilla gardens and graffiti.. . “It’s time for people to go home, it is time for us to restore Cal Anderson and Capitol Hill so it can be a vibrant part of the community,” Durkan said. “The impacts on the businesses and residents and the community are now too much.”. . Shifting the protests away from evening hours mirrors changes sought by some protesters themselves.. . Some organizers affiliated with the protest zone distributed an unsigned letter Sunday calling for “suggested” CHOP hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to encourage the area “to stop being a chaotic, immobile zone” in the overnight hours, though their plan called for some people to remain through the night.. .

The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ),[6] also known as Free Capitol Hill,[7][8] the Capitol Hill Organized Protest[9][10][11] and the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP),[12][13][14] is an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone[1] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park,[15][16] was established by George Floyd protesters on June 8, 2020 after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) vacated its East Precinct building.[17]. . Local governance in the zone is decentralized, with the goal of creating a neighborhood without police. Purported demands associated with the zone include rent control, the reversal of gentrification, the abolition or defunding of police, funding of community health, and releasing prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest, with expungement of their records.[18][19]. . Reactions to the zone have varied through the political spectrum. President Donald Trump referred to the occupants as "ugly Anarchists" and called for the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle to "take back" the zone,[5] while Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 11 described the zone as "four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public."[20] On June 14, USA Today confirmed the festive atmosphere, reporting that protesters who had previously clashed with police "have had their rough edges dulled by tens of thousands of tourists and sightseers. CHAZ has morphed into what looks and feels like a mini Burning Man festival."[3]. . Following the zone's founding, SPD Chief Carmen Best said that the police department was looking at different approaches to "reduce [their] footprint" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood[21] but later said that officials were working to return police officers to the precinct. She stressed the "need to have officers responding to calls in a timely fashion. And with the occupation that's taking place, we're not able to do so in a timely way."[22] On June 14, Chief Best spoke of having marched with Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the zone two days before: "I was looking at the 60,000 people that were there, signs saying, you know, defund the police, stop police brutality, you know, no qualified immunity. [...] And I just realized it was a moment, an epiphany, that this is a pivotal moment in history. We are going to move in a different direction and policing will never be the same as it was before."[23]. . On June 12, BLM protesters were reportedly negotiating with local officials to leave the zone.[24] Four days later, the zone's roadblocks were replaced and moved,[25] allowing for emergency service vehicles to pass through and decreasing CHAZ's size to three blocks.[26]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 94.48275600000001%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGOiU7va-Vs" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CGOiU7va-Vs/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHOP #CHAZ Shooting #3 Gang Land Warfare?

Seattle police union tossed out of King County labor council. . The King County labor council threw out the Seattle police officers union in a contentious vote Wednesday night.. . The decision comes amid protests around the country against police brutality that have highlighted the role police unions play in maintaining the status quo.. . About 55% of delegates to the council, called MLK Labor, voted to expel the Seattle Police Officers Guild.. . The council is an umbrella organization that represents over 100,000 workers and more than 150 unions.. . The vote could increase pressure on elected officials in Seattle to hold police more accountable in future contracts.. . The police union has been seen as an impediment to some of the reforms that have long been sought, including those demanded by federal court oversight that the Seattle department has been under for a decade.. .

The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ)[4][5] or the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest[a] (CHOP),[5][7][8] also known as Free Capitol Hill,[9][10][11] is an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone[1] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.[12] The zone,[5] originally covering six city blocks and a park,[13][14] was established on June 8, 2020 by George Floyd protesters after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) vacated its East Precinct building.[15]. . Local governance in the zone is decentralized, with the goal of creating a neighborhood without police. Purported demands associated with the zone include rent control, the reversal of gentrification, the abolition or defunding of police, funding of community health, and releasing prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest, with expungement of their records.[16][17]. . Reactions to the zone have varied through the political spectrum. President Donald Trump referred to the occupants as "ugly Anarchists" and called for the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle to "take back" the zone,[18] while Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 11 described the zone as "four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public."[19] On June 14, USA Today confirmed the festive atmosphere, reporting that protesters who had previously clashed with police "have had their rough edges dulled by tens of thousands of tourists and sightseers. CHAZ has morphed into what looks and feels like a mini Burning Man festival."[3]. . Following the zone's founding, SPD Chief Carmen Best said that the police department was looking at different approaches to "reduce [their] footprint" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood[20] but later said that officials were working to return police officers to the precinct. She stressed the "need to have officers responding to calls in a timely fashion. And with the occupation that's taking place, we're not able to do so in a timely way."[21] On June 14, Chief Best spoke of having marched with Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the zone two days before: "I was looking at the 60,000 people that were there, signs saying, you know, defund the police, stop police brutality, you know, no qualified immunity. [...] And I just realized it was a moment, an epiphany, that this is a pivotal moment in history. We are going to move in a different direction and policing will never be the same as it was before."[22]. . On June 12, BLM protesters were reportedly negotiating with local officials to leave the zone.[23] Four days later, the zone's roadblocks were replaced and moved,[24] allowing for emergency service vehicles to pass through and decreasing CHAZ's size down to 3 blocks.[25]</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 91.111106%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41bdjJC29Ag" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41bdjJC29Ag/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHAZ #CHOP Journal 6/16/2020.

On Monday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, who has repeatedly clashed with President Trump over her handling of the CHOP, tweeted: “Seattle won't lose sight of what we need: allowing our community to exercise their first amendment rights, demilitarizing our police force, rethinking who responds to 9-1-1 calls, and investing more to create meaningful change for our black and brown communities.”</p><div class="youtube-video-rating"><div class="youtube-video-rating-filler" style="width: 36%;"></div></div></a><a class="youtube-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78YFt6ZvN9U" target="_blank"><img class="youtube-video-thumb lazy" src="" data-lazysrc="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/78YFt6ZvN9U/hqdefault.jpg"><p class="youtube-video-title">#CHAZ #CHOP Journal 6/15/2020.

A lone criminal attacked and stole from an autoshop on the outskirts of CHAZ. After the SPD refused to intervene, the criminal was eventually detained by the owner himself, who was carrying a gun. Witnessing the detainment without context, a mob penetrated the fence of the property but was swiftly held back by its own members, who successfully protected the borders of the property while individuals from CHAZ investigated the situation.
